one day -- my darling love -- one day  
i'll pour for you some chardonnay  

we'll sit and sip a sparkling white  
and relish in its sour bite  

and drunk on your inspiring spell  
i'll try a bit of zinfandel  

and you -- before you go away --  
might sample some of my ros√©  

we'll drink ourselves a nightcap sherry  
and hand in hand i'll make you merry  

i'd love to take you out to dine  
we'll eat a feast, i'll buy you wine  

we'll find a quiet life to live  
i'll give you all i have to give
