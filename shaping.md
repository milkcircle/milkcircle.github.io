i think i might be losing my voice singing to you, darling  

interesting how the ambulance sirens are in key  

i don't know if you're here, can you send me a sign?

i hope you know it is a joy to sing to you  
(though i wonder if the same could be said of listening to my singing...)  

"... you don't know how lovely you are...  
it's such a shame for us to part..."
