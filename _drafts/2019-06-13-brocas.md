it's an  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effortful  
&nbsp;&nbsp;thing,  

this.  

i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you  

...us  

and i can't  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seem to find  

the  

the words  

the words to tell you  

that you  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make my heart  

flutter and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sing  

and when you  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smile...  

i have no words.
