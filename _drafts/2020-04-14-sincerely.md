in this  
uncomfortable space  
where beginnings end  
and ends begin,  

time exposes rot  
and patience wears thin,  

and crafting poetry  
out of pain  
and excuses  
out of hope  
becomes pointless  

for what will change will change,  
and what will not will not,  
and it is neither up to  
god nor the devil to decide  
what type of aging soul one becomes  
and what one is willing to kill to get there.
