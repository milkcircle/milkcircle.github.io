F cells are erythrocytes that contain HbF. The number of F cells is strongly linearly correlated with %HbF in hemolysates. In other words, the number of cells containing HbF is a suitable proxy for the amount of HbF contained within red blood cells.

HbF is heritable, per a twin heritability study.
