*prechorus*  
in subtle haste, your eyes  
brim with tears  
that speak the truths  
of a thousand years  

in quiet breaths you speak  
your final words  
secret feelings  
that are left unheard  

*chorus*  
and though you've left me  
and you've gone away  
i remember  
every single day  

orphaned butterfly  
left in dust --  
lonely ironworks  
set to rust...
