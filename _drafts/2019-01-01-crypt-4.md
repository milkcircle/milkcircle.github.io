howling winds carry Mother Earth's sorrowful sighs  
newly birthed from the storm stirred by butterfly wings;  
your flushed face shivers under the winter moon.

by the frozen river, under twenty-four flights of slippery steps  
your once-friend's pale face, immutably drained of its lively pink cheeks, is now an  
electric blue, a cyan goodbye barely distinguishable from its surrounding basin of tears.
