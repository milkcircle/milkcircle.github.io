rage  

boils away  
in this pot,  

and its heat  

is used  
to soften  
the noodles  

that nourish  
the bond  
between us,  

for what is convection  
but the conviction  
to transfer the fervor  
of short-lived anger  
into the passion  
of long-lived love  

and what is the kitchen  
but the science  
of preparing  
tangible love  
for human consumption?
