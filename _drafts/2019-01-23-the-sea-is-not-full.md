sometimes i imagine  
the things we might do  
on our hard-earned breaks  
like go on a rickety european train-track trip  
or take a cruise somewhere, i don't care  
we'd eat exotic foods  
and giggle when the wine runs down our faces  
and we'd be too busy giving each other sly tipsy glances  
to notice our nice clothes being stained  
and we'd decorate ourselves  
with little gifts from each other  
and punctuate our fun  
with handheld naps  
and i'd dot your cheeks  
with little bird pecks  

but all i have to give  
are my thoughts for you to read  
and my heart for you to feel  
and my hand for you to hold  

sometimes i imagine  
that that'd be enough  

and i hear you sigh...  
"isn't it pretty to think so?"
