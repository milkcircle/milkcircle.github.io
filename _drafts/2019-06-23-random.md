tell me something random.  

i'll give a penny for your thoughts  
i'll give you my two cents  
and though each one is small  
i'll amass for you a fortune  
in attention and ideas

tell me something random  
and i'll sort through all the chaos  
and pen for you a storybook  
where everything makes sense  

tell me something random  
and we'll chat the night away  
i'll sift through all your worries  
and i'll shoulder all your pain
