they taught us that language is bound!by rules  
that's what they told us all in schools(those  
fools)  

our language  
is a cornerful structureless yours-and-minefield  
of steely irony and stainful rust  

your heartbeats! our syntax true  
three hearty syll-a-bles in i-love-you  

show them all that a vibrant  
meandering meandyou slanguage  
can have meaningful made-up words  

and show them how  
we talk in breaths and  
we breathe in little cheeky pecks  

(and that your words live in my mindless mind  
like a moon that belongs in the night-of-day  
or the twinkles belong to the stars)  

it's whatever your sighs carry the winds  
whatever your hands caress  

and it's whatever syllables spring  
from your lips, a smile to my face you'll bring
