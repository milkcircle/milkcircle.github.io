[Primary Hyperparathyroidism -- NEJM]({{ site.url }}/download/201809_primary_hyperparathyroidism.pdf)

### Epidemiology

* More common in women compared to men
* Those with *normocalcemic* hyperparathyroidism are not spared from skeletal complications
* The overwhelming majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a single parathyroid ademona

### Symptoms

* Moderate to severe hypercalcemia can cause hypercalcemia and is a risk factor for pancreatitis
* Consider associated symptoms in syndromes like multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (these patients can have parathyroid tumors and gastrinomas)

### Complications

* Can lead to bone loss and elevated fracture risk
    - Bone loss seems to occur more at the femoral neck and radius compared to spine
    - There is increased risk of fracture at the spine, wrist, rib, and pelvis
	- Whether hip fractures increase with PHP is unclear
* Nephrolithiasis
	- Patients with mixed calcium oxalate-apatite stones or pure apatite stones are more likely to have PHP compared to those with renal stones composed of calcium oxalate
* Psychiatric manifestations such as declining memory and concentration, depression, anxiety
* Cardiovascular disease in the form of changes to LV mass and function as well as other cardiac changes

### Diagnosis

* Look for hypercalcemia with PTH levels that are inappropriately normal or high
* Serum $$\textrm{25-(OH)D}$$ is usually normal or low-normal
	- The reason for this is because PTH converts $$\textrm{25-(OH)D}$$ to $$\textrm{1,25-(OH)}_2\textrm{D}$$ 
* Beware confusing PHP with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism
* Look for family history of related genetic diseases
	- Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 have heterozygous LOF in CaSR; these patients are asymptomatic and do not require treatment
	- MEN 1 and MEN 2 can lead to four-gland hyperplasia
	- Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome is associated with more severe hypercalcemia and are at increased risk for recurrence and parathyroid carcinoma
* Drugs
	- Long-term lithium therapy can cause an identical clinical picture
	- Thiazide diuretics are often thought to worsen hypercalcemia in patients with HP, but this is probably not the case in those with mild disease
* Low threshold to pursue renal ultrasound and 24-hour urine calcium measurement
* Bone densitometry at the spine, hip, and distal third of the radius is helpful and sensitive to effects of HP

### Management overview

* Surgery is the first-line treatment
	- Recommended for 1) patients with $$\textrm{Ca}^{2+}$$ more than 1.0 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal range, 2) patients < 50 years old, 3) men and peri/post-menopausal women over age 50 with T scores < -2.5 at a central bone densitometry site or distal third of the radius or who have recently had a fragility fracture
* The following are individual indications for surgery:
	- GFR < 60 mL/min
	- Renal stones
	- UCa > 400 mg/day
* Low threshold to pursue neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric testing

### Imaging

* Ultrasound
	- Safe with high PPV, but cannot detect mediastinal adenomas
* Sestamibi 
	- Helpful for localizing tumor and can detect ectopic tissue
* Dynamic CT 
	- Good for identifying multiple/ectopic adenomas and in patients needing more than one operation
* MRI
	- Same as CT but no need for radiation. Slightly lower sensitivity/PPV compared to CT

### Surgery

* Intraoperative PTH should be collected; expect this to decrease by at least 50% and into the normal range
* After operation, hold antiosteoporotic therapy to see how the bone mass improves by itself
* Preoperative serum levels of c-telopeptide of type 1 collagen are correlated with degree of gain in bone mass after surgery
* RCTs have shown that cardiovascular and neurocognitive outcomes do not improve after surgical intervention for hyperparathyroidism

### Medical management

* For those patients who cannot tolerate surgery, recommend annual serum $$\textrm{Ca}^{2+}$$ measurement and repeat measurements of bone density
* Patients with history of renal stones should have annual imaging of kidneys and a 24h urine biochemical profile
* Recommend a calcium-sufficient diet, and use Vitamin D supplements as necessary to maintain serum $$\textrm{25-(OH)D}$$ between 20-30 ng/mL
	- Dietary sources of calcium are always preferred
* Cinacalcet improves serum calcium and PTH, but had no significant effect on bone loss
* Antiresorptive therapy (bisphosphonates, etc.) can lead to increase in bone mass, but do not correct the hypercalcemia in hyperparathyroidism
* Thiazide diuretics may reduce risk of nephrolithiasis through reduction of urine calcium excretion
	- Though no evidence of concomitant serum calcium increase, regular monitoring of blood calcium is still advised
