here, i said  
handing her a  
slip of paper with  
an iou,  
wincing in shame  
at the  
not-enoughness of the moment,  
the vulnerability of  
my inability to trade out  
the paper for money or  
jewelry or tickets,  

here,  
i saved up for this and it's  
not much  

and i looked at her standing  
on a mound of ivory and  
glittering things and then looked  
at my grubby paper that said iou  
and felt the hot downward glare  
at my worthless self,  

here.  

the ocean of glittering things  
swallowed me, ripped the paper to  
shreds, tore the voice from my  
chest, and i fell backward  
down the ladder of status and class  

and landed, broken, in a tin of  
grime, shattered dreams,  
looking up at her  
upturned nose grimacing at the  
smudge made by my presence  
and the shreds of paper that once said  

iou
