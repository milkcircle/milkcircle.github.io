she said her  
familiar apologies,  
vows to change,  
and leaked her  
acted tears;  

and he said  
that to hope  
for change in her  
was to wait for  
life to end:  
hope, especially  
in the hopeless,  
is as undeserved  
as success for the slothful.  

i looked at them both,  
and accepted his words,  
for hope, to me, has been  
a wretched thing with feathers  
that flew too close to the sun.
