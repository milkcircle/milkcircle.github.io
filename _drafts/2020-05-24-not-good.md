you are not good, though i  
never tell this to you.  you are  
not good, not the unconscious immoral thoughts  
nor the greedy acts, and i mourn  
the people who you shoot in the heart  
and who you kick when they're down, though  
i never tell this to you.  
i never show you the wasteland of  
the dead you've tortured, the  
disappointment of people who expected more from you,  
the agony of those who give everything  
so they can have more taken away.  
i'm trying to keep you from this, because  
underneath it all you've got a good skeleton with  
a profound mind, and any halfway decent friend  
would take a fucked up companion who's done bad shit  
and instead of rubbing it in, show her there's more to life  
than this, that she's got good bones,  
that it's the choices from this point forward that matter:  
you could stop, you could be good, this could be wonderful.
