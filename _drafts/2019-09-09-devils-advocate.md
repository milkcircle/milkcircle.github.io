i've been the devil's advocate,   
been inside the devil's head  
impaled myself with the devil's horns  
shared the heat of the devil's bed  

i've been the devil's greatest fan,  
wiped the devil's two-faced tears  
bought the devil's lavish meals  
given the devil all my years  

i've been the devil's champion  
her greatest admirer from afar  
wished to God that she would change  
tried to be her biggest star  

i've been the devil's instrument  
her pawn, her puppet, backup tool;  
in wishing that she'd change her ways  
i've been made a motley fool.  

the devil -- center of her crowd  
always amidst a throng of friends --  
nevertheless is known by no-one,  
living this life of pure pretend  

how strange it is, isn't it?  
that even amidst a crowd so loud  
that picks you up and cheers you on  
celebrates you, proud  

beneath your cracking dim facade  
your lies are all your own  
and in this crowd that cheers your name  
you are so alone...  

for no-one knows the genuine you  
only the sketch you've drawn  
and those who could've helped you grow  
you've cast away; they're gone  

i've been the devil's advocate  
and i've been cast aside...  
and though it burned and tore me up  
at least i know i've tried.
