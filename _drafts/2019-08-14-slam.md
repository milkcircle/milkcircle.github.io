there is a pasture of poetry  
that flourishes in september winds.  
i will meet you there.  
when two souls lie down in the fields  
where crops of ideas begin to grow  
and our whispers rustle the weeds like  
a gentle quiet breeze, reminding us  
of our vision of a mediterranean grayscale  
sky, and when the warm passing rains  
water the grass  

i will meet you there  
to watch this garden come alive.
