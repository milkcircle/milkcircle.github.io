what is light  
without a little shade?  

could you imagine  
a blank sheet of paper  
with no black ink to tell a tale?  

or a day  
without a night  
and a sunset to watch?  

what is life  
without blemishes  
and spots to mark the time?  

there's no light  
that the dark  
couldn't make a little brighter  

and your skin  
with no butterfly  
wouldn't flutter my heart the same...  

i'm in the dark  
waiting for the curtains to open to your shine.
