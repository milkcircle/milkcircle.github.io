on eve's eve  
we sit in front of  
burning wood, embers  
making sounds like the  
soft jolts that adorned  
the night we first met,  
and --  

as did the heat between us  
turn lukewarm, so do the  
ashes in the fireplace, and  
the hot chocolate i sip,  
and you, until  

we are as cold  
as the tiles that separate us,  
as the snow that dusts my frozen tears,  
as the quaking heart we used to share
