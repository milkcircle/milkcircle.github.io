i twi  
twi  
twitch.  
twitch.  

i scratch  
my nev  
erend  
ing  
itch.  

she looks my way  

i nod  
nod  

i look away.  

a glimpse of blue  
skirt  
shirt  

i stut  
stut  
stutter and stammer  

a he-  
hello, my na-  
name is  

she looks my way  

i look away.  

and in my mind  
a fluent speech  
a fluid greeting  
confessing love  

and out my mouth  
a jumbled  
mess  

a stut  
stutter  

i run away.
