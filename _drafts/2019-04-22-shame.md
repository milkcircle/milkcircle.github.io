what an utter shame  
that your outer beauty  
houses but the ugliest of souls  

that you must mask your inner demons  
with a dying shell of a carcass  

that you live with the intent of deceit  

that you have forgotten how sweet honesty tastes  

and how good it is  
to have someone appreciate you for you  
and not your cracking facade.  

what an utter shame  
that your husk  
is filled with rot  
rather than gold.
