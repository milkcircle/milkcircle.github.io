your attention has become  
a scarce commodity  

and each of my uttered words  
scanned by your quiet eyes  
has become worth its weight in gold  

as a dying mother chooses her final words carefully  
for her weary impatient children  

so too these words have been chosen carefully  
for your eyes and yours alone:  

i tend to butterflies gently  
and take seriously the concept of forgiveness  
especially to those who do not deserve it  

i will tend your garden while you are gone.
