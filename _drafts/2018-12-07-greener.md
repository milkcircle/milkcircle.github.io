A little over a year ago  
A butterfly perched upon my shoulder  
A pretty creature with paper thin wings  
A fragile little thing

I thought she might fly off  
But she stuck around

So I fed her  
And offered her a tiny flower garden  
And carried her around so she might enjoy the scenery

Today I woke up  
And my friend was no longer there  
I tore the room apart searching for her

Did someone take her?  
Could an animal have eaten her?  
Did she die?

For hours I destroyed this room in a frantic fury  
A terrible tornado, a desperate storm  
Until I noticed her glistening wings at the windowsill

She looked toward me  
Then turned the other way  

And I looked at my little flower garden  
Now worn, wilted  
And looked outside at greener pastures  

And I opened the window  

And without so much as a whisper she was gone.
