how strange  
that i, after much prodding,  
agreed to attend the funeral of your conscience  
only to find that  
you didn't even show up  

i laid your conscience to rest  
and -- in my quiet muttered ode --  
apologized on your behalf  
knowing deep down you were somewhere else  
at a party perhaps  
celebrating and mumbling "good riddance."
