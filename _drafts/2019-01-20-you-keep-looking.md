i know you keep looking  
like you're searching  
for some sign that  
i'm still  
hanging  
on  

isn't that all you've ever wanted?  
to feel wanted? to be wanted?  
at all costs? to feel chased  
admired, for the facade  
you put up, to mask  
the guilty  
conscience  
underneath

don't you know  
i've lived a  
life before  
you, and  
i intend  
to do so  
again?  

you've been replaced  
by somebody better.  
i thought you  
of all people  
might want  
to know.  

and i've never been happier  
except for maybe the moment  
i realized that  
i should stop  
chasing your  
blackened  
charred  
heart  

and now every day i think  
about how much better  
my life is without  
your bitter  
deceitful  
soul  

and how much easier it is  
to fully love someone  
who truly loves me  
back

i'd wish you well, but  
honestly,  

i don't think i care anymore.
