i whisper my vernacular into her  
albino ears, words dripping with  
caustic corners in the ornate  
ornithine metabolites that adorn  
her quiet wistful dress, the  
parisian inspired statues, the  
museum-influenced families, the  
red-and-white of ballgames near  
and blues of histories far,  
the long train rides to and fro  
of interactive plays galore, of  
futures torn like shredded wheats  
and pasts fogged like franciscan  
mornings.  

goodness! how these words fall  
upon deaf and dying ears, how  
the streams of consciousness  
become eddying rivers of comatose  
sedatives that keep an addict down,  
how seconds apart from wisdom  
have torn you from the hereafter  
you promised to yourself and to  
these lips that whispered the quiet  
vernacular into your twitching  
adolescent ears.
