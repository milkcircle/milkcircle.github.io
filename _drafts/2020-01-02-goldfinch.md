tomorrow, we will enter the museum  
and only i will leave, face  
covered in ash, coughing, delirious,  
concussed, reeling, vomiting, confused,  
lost, bleeding, flayed open by shrapnel,  
and i will call your name and you will not  
respond.  

but tonight we are giddy with excitement  
at the thought of the museum, the portal  
that will take us from this wretched place,  
the glistening palaces past, the  
oils and watercolors and jewels and  
frames and pottery  

and in the middle of it all, a chained-up  
bird, which is to be the foreground in  
a shredded future without you.
