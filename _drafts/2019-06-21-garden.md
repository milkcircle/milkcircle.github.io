if i were a god  
i would be a gardener  

and every night i would water the skies for you  

we'd lie on the lawn  
to watch the burgeoning stars grow brighter and brighter  
and the moon grow fuller and fuller  

and when the moon grows ripe for picking  
i'd pluck it from its spot in the sky  
and harvest the constellations  

and prepare a shimmering celestial feast  
for you to enjoy until the end of time.
