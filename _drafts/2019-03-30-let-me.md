let me whisper to you softly  
those words meant only for your ears  
the resolute and still unwavering song  
to wipe away your sorrows and your fears  

let me hold your hands but gently  
a touch meant only for your skin  
to cover all your soul with fingers rugged  
and in this winter, warm you from within  

let me drink your thoughtful poison  
that bleach which burns my swallows hard  
for rather i would kill my own internals  
than let you suffer but a single scar  

let me weep your woeful teardrops  
and carry out my life beneath the gray  
i'll summon all the stormy clouds around me  
to pave for you a shining, singsong day  

let me carry all your burdens  
upon my shoulders, let them sink me in the mud  
for i shall dedicate to you my lovely:  
my tears, my sweat, my toil, and my blood
