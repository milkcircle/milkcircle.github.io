i remember when   
i first learned about gravity  
and magnetism and electricity  

i wondered to myself,  
how do people discover these  
invisible forces  
they cannot sense?  

though in school i learned their names  
solved their equations  
derived their laws  

it was always odd to me that we knew so much  
about things we could see so little of.  

then you left  

and i understood  
that there is an enormity  
to the absence  
of cherished things  

and i learned  
that one can drown  
without the presence of water  

and that one can go blind  
in the absence of physical darkness.  

i learned  
that the deprivation of a loved one  
can be heavier  
than the excess of hatred,  

that the omission of your words  
stings more  
than the insults of my worst enemy  

that the poverty of touch  
hurts more  
than the hardest of punches.  

dark matter is  
the crushing reminder  
that the lack of a thing  
will always dwarf what is there  

just as you  
will always remind me  
what is there  

and what so clearly isn't.
