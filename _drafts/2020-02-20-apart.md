in time,  
i'll gather your ashes  
into a mahogany urn,  
and take you to the river charles,  
where breath by breath  
i'll whisper the reasons i've loved you  
as i release you into the wind  

but tonight,  
tonight we will lie beneath the moon,  
apart,  
pointing and watching the battles  
depicted by the stars  
as we feel the war  
unfold inside our hearts,  
not knowing that we pray the same prayers  
while we wait for some sign within us  
to show us where the wind will blow.
