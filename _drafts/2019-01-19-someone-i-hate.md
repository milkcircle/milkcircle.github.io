i want to meet someone i hate  
someone who enrages me  
drives me up the fucking wall  
fills my eyes with boiling red  

i want to meet someone i despise  
someone i cannot wait to leave  
who's so full of shit  
rotten to the core, and spiteful too  

i want to meet someone like that  
who i can argue with and tear apart in my mind  
who i can spend every day being thankful  
that i don't have that person in my life  

but instead  
i met you  
and what can i do  
but want more of you  
and wish you'd want me too?
