wear your pain upon your shoulders  
let them crush me like these boulders  
let our dying fires smolder  
let your inner light shine true  

may your solemn passions shine  
heave them heavy on my spine  
let your torment bury mine  
like the taming of the shrew  

were your language incomplete  
as in g√∂del's last conceit  
suggesting truths we'll never meet  
like sets of proven statements few  

or may our final short farewell  
break the never-ending spell  
of the luminescent belle  
to end our bonds -- through and through
