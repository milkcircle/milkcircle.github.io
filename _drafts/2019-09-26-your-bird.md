i awake to a centaur  
standing tall beside me  

mars is bright tonight  
he whispers  

mars is bright tonight  

he points toward  
the quiet virgilian hippogriff
stamping its hooves  
in the tearstained sand  

another bird -- the sturdy centaur sighs --  
is preparing to take flight  

and in this schizophrenic mythologic hellscape  
i look up to see a burning planet  
(indeed, mars is bright tonight)  

and wish in my heart of hearts  
that my straining eyes might catch a glimpse of  
pluto's pinprick light  
to dissolve the impending internal war  
prophesized by the prescient behemoth beside me.
