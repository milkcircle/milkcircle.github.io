blink hard -- dear -- collect your tears  
and the next time life turns bland  
add some seasoning with your salt and grief  

pour your heart and soul into  
the little gooseneck kettle  
and boil until it whistles... take its pitch  

and tune your heartsong to its key  
sip the tea of your tears,  
and write your lyrics to taste like that.  

who cares if you're not in tune?  
when you sing, the stars that dot the night sky  
shine a little bit brighter.  

when you sing,  
the universe sings.
