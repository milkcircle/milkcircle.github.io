words console  
(but not enough)  
and smiles restore  
but leave tiny  
mothbitten holes  
and glances warm  
enough to melt  
but not enough to revive  
and touch shocks  
but only just  
and never to resuscitate  

and there is a potential space  
and quiet enough  
to fill this room  
with lonesome want for more.
