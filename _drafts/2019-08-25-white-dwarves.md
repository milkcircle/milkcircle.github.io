they say when you look up at the stars  
some fraction of them has already died.  

distance warps our perception of time  
and what is immediate to us  
is history to others.  

the winds brought to me your scent  
and my bloodshot eyes and bloodhound nose  
followed its trail.  

the winds brought me to the waters  
the calming waves beckoning, as though  
asking me for a gentle kiss.  

bukowski's voice rang in my ears:  
"nothing else fills," he reminds me.  
"nothing else fills."  

i looked past the harbor lights  
and hallucinated that soulful choreiform country far away  
as though it were one of the midnight stars  

wondering to myself  
whether that star too  
has already died,  
and whether what i see  
is only a seductive decoy  
of a Sunlit past  
before the Sun which lit my day  
retreated so far away  
that she became a distant star  
i could only pretend to see  
if i squinted hard enough.
