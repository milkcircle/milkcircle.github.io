should the planet fall away  
to endless pitch, the light absorbed  
nor heavens, nor hell, nor earthly haven  
surviving, lest be swallowed shut  
by vacuum into nothingness  
smaller than a pinprick spot  

i shall seek thy radiance  
in that somber twilit instant   
for only in reflective blaze  
this darkness may recede.
