I ordered an immersion blender to make creamed soups. This recipe makes enough for 4 hearty servings.  

Ingredients:
* 1 head cauliflower
* 0.5 lb bacon
* 1 medium onion
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 1 cup half and half
* 6 scallions
* 4 cloves garlic

1. Crisp the bacon, then remove with slotted spoon.
2. Soften onions with garlic and half the scallions in the bacon fat, roughly 5 min
3. Add chopped cauliflower, chicken stock, half 'n half or cream, then cook for 30 min, simmering the entire time
4. Blend the soup
5. Serve with bacon and scallion as garnish
