trust  
is a slick substance:  
it takes but a  
simple slip  
to reveal your cards,  
and the whole  
castle tumbles down,  
as the startled observer  
finds out  
where you are,  
what skeletons you've hidden,  
and wonders what in the world  
went awry  
to create such malevolent deceit  
what he's done  
to deserve it  
and why things never change
