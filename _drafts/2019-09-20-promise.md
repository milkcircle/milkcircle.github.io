remember, love -- when the going gets tough  
when the storm in your rage shouts "enough is enough"  
when you feel like your effort is not up to snuff  
and the soft of your heart becomes calloused and rough  

remember, love -- we breathe the same air  
and i'm not religious but i'll send you a prayer  
your pain and your misery and your anger i'll share  
and when you cannot go on i'll be there i swear
