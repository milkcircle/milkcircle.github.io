a month ago  
the government  
in response to the cheapening of human interaction  
rationed social gatherings,  
banning groups  
and enforcing isolation  

there is a magic  
to human touch  
that, in the hustle and bustle  
of the everyman routine,  
is lost  
like the enchantment of music is masked  
in noise,  
or the power of words is obscured  
among chatter  

it is what is forgotten  
in the confinement  
of prison,  
what thickens the shells of solitary men,  
what mutes the mouths of once-jolly children:  
this tragic loss of  
human contact  

i knew not the treasures i had  
until by force  
they removed you from me.
