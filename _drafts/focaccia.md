are you happier without me?  
does it make life easier  
to be the wall  
for which i sing  
and never hear back at all?  

will you talk to me?  
will you find me?  
do you hate me?  
why do you hate me?  

i'm running out of steam, my dear  
but i'll sing a few more for you to hear  
all the feelings i have for you  
and all the feelings i wish you had too  

find me one day, darling  
i am here, i am here  
and though you hide away from me  
i'm with you far and near  

aaroncheng.me/  
{ where i'd hoped to take you some day in the far off future  
where i'd been before, and you'd been too (i think)  
but where we'd never been together  
"i wish you were here with me" }
