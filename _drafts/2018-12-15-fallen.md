If the moon explodes  
And the stars stop sparkling  
And the sun no longer rises  

If the oceans stop moving  
And the trees no longer rustle  
And the birds have gone away  

If the undergrowth is aflame  
And the air is filled with smoke  
And the ground cracks in envy  

If a tree falls in the forest  
And nobody's there  
To witness the life lost  

If the heart shatters  
And nobody's there  
To pick up the pieces  

Did it really happen?
