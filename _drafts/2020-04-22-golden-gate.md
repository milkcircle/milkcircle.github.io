across the great expanse of silence  
that bridges you and me  
i feel the need to tell you  
i know what i can't see  

which is to say...  
there's no tailor in sight  
and i can spy  
the truth in the dimmest of the night  

may the bay  
take away  
the mightiest of lies  
and let the honest sleep  
rid of parasites.
