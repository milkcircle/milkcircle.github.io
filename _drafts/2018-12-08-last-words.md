Is this what dying feels like?  
Shallow breaths  
Blurry vision from dried-out eyes  
Twisted tongue fumbling words  
Nausea and churning guts  
Shaking limbs, shivering like the cold before the ultimate cold

Is this what dying feels like?

Then before the lights dim  
Before my breath catches  
Before my eyes glaze and  
I am overtaken by the final sleep  
Let me impart my dying words:

I've loved you  
And I wish this were longer
