we met a few years too late.  

perhaps under  
curtained clouds of teenaged skies  
when our minds  
buzzing with history, science, and wine  

may have clashed in bookish form,  
our hearts spilling like  
our papers from our bags  

the gaze from our starling eyes  
may have collided too  

would our impact have melted us  
cemented us together?  

or would we, elastic as we are  
have sprung apart shyly  
the sum total of our interaction  
so miniscule to have left only  
the faintest wisp of memory?
