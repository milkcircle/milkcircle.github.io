stones erode  
with raining tears  

as trust  
rusts  
in shrouded lies  

and burning bridges  
stand resolute,  
smoldering in bitter smog,  

onlookers pointing,  
wondering whether the fragile ropes  
will ever snap  

and throw the contemplating  
suicidal jumpers  
against their ultimate will  
into the frigid cold below
