you're electric.  

i never knew this until  
i barely brushed you the other day  
and my hair stood up on end  
and my heart raced  
so i could hardly breathe  

and the spark on my skin made me  

yelp!  

and yelp only i could  
for my dry mouth had lost its words.  

you're electric.  

and when i barely brushed you  
your jolt shot me across the room  
and slammed me so hard  
that when i looked at you i saw stars.  

i finally came to  
from that haze of confusion  

only to sense a strange desire  
to feel that shock once more...  

you're electric.
