reach! reach! reach for the stars  
high 'bove the clouds and get burned by the sun  

mourn! mourn! mourn for the dead  
for the skeletal ashes of purity lost  

fall! down! tumble and turn  
bounce then rise up for you aren't yet done  

live! learn! face no regret  
brush yourself off then confront the new frost  

forgive the remorseless, forget the reviled  
sharpen your soul and then bury the wild

you motley fool, don't drown in your sorrow  
open your eyes to another tomorrow  

let the goliaths confront their demise  
for you are but level, grounded and wise...  

give! give! give them your heart  
rejoice as those serpentine demons depart!
