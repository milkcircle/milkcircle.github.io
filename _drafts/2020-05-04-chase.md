that sharp edge  
where laughter meets tears,  
unlobotomized, unprocessed  
emotion,  

unstifled by the  
dull comforts of the money-  
hungry, unsuffocated by  
the pomp and circumstance  
of reputation-seekers,  

is a transient,  
out-of-reach rainbow,  
and its thrilling chase  
is all i can promise.
