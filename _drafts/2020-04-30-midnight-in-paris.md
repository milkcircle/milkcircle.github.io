to let go  
in mind,  
yet concede  
the heart  
will want what  
the heart wants,  

feels somewhat like  
a midnight stroll  
in paris, eyes  
seeing what it wishes  
were there,  
hearing whispers of  
films past,  
catching glimpses of  
a soft butterfly,  
floating, as elegant  
as in dreams,  
and as transient as  
in reality.
