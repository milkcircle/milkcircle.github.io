little by little, big by big  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from your heart's flask i take a swig  
one by one and three by three  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i tap your shoulder, dance with me  

up the hall and down the river  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your lips upon mine tremble-quiver  
here and there and through and through  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i whisk you home just me and you  

yin and yang and you and i  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold each other eye to eye  
sweet my words and sweet your heart  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our beauty is a work of art  

east by south and north by west  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'll follow you a doting guest  
now and then and here and there  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a never-ending handheld pair
