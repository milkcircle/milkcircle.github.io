the moon cannot shine  
without the Sun  

flowers will not blossom  
without bees  

immunity won't spark  
without its requisite toxin  

and i cannot breathe  
without you, my heart.  

a yin without its yang  
is like  

a sock without its twin  
a fish without water  
a bird without feathers  

it is as tragic as  
a boy with no mother  

as naked as  
a child with no blanket  

as empty as  
a lung with no air...  

i, without you, my dear  
am a man without wealth  
and currency only in dreams...  

tread lightly, love,  
because you tread upon my dreams.
