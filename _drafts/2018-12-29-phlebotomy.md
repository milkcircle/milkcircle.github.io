she places her hand upon mine  
feeling those tortuous veins and valves  
forming tributaries that empty into riverbeds  
and she follows their route up up up  
in search of the origin waterfall  
until at the forearm she loses the way.  

she returns with a tourniquet  
and with that gentle squeeze i feel the pulsing of my heart  
echoing beneath her electric touch  
and she finds her way back to the ichorous stream  
sliding her hand yet again along that path toward the cradle  

i can feel my maximal impulse pounding anticipation into the rivers  
as though to show her the way toward the basin she seeks  
my mind eddying like the torrents my heart produces, until  

suddenly  

my eyes see red  
my mind screams  
and, looking down,  
a sliver of silver glistens like the glint in her eyes  
and i watch as the riverbeds dry and the riverplants die  

and i wonder whether  
this pain will ever subside  
whether the freshets will ever fill  
whether i will ever trust another person to lay their hand on mine again
