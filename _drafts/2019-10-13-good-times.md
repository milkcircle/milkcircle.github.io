we, frustrated  
sit in silence  
ruminating in our impatience  
our poverty of experience and  
our illness of ambition  

hand in hand  
in disingenuous insincerity  
as though our touch were only a gesture  

and we look out the windows of our  
towers, this  
voluntary imprisonment,  
mourning our trapped souls  
refusing to look at the wide-open door  
or the huddled masses fighting their way in  

were a transcendent god at this moment  
to look in our direction,  
he might shake his head and sigh to himself  

"if only there was a way to know  
when you're in the good old days  
before the good old days have gone away."
