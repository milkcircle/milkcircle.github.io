he and she in an overgrown grove  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quiet whispers in a silent alcove  
she and she in a sing-song band  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opera-screams while hand in hand  

she and he on a lullaby ride  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fantasy eyes seeing husband and bride  
he and he in a warm cocoon  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shouting their sins all out-of-tune  

you and i in a tree-house high  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filling our lungs with an airy sigh  
i and you in a beachhouse blue  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say we will and say we do  

roots are we in a family tree  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave these branches  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave us be
