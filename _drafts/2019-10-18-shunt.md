in a split second  
like a gasping blood cell  
hungering for air  
reaching, reaching at the lungs  
and  

shunted away  
to a lower-pressure circulation  
where it, blue in the face  
exhales its remaining breath  
before being hemolyzed  

so it is that i  
blue in the face  
gasping, gasping for air  
reach for you with arms outstretched  
and, at last, hearing your quiet echoes  

am shunted away at the last moment  
forced to endure the long, long journey  
to bring me back to you again
