hold tight onto  
those moments, which --  
like spring, lasts but only  
for a phrenic catch of breath;  

and those dreams, which  
steep like floral tea, and dissipate  
in the quiet mind's unending ocean,  
to impart subtle color to a  
deep and somber hue...  

hold tight to me,  
for i am but an ephemeral whisper  
of a secret, hidden beneath the  
creaks of the house settling,  
light thumps of covered footsteps and  
evening giggles which dissolve into  
the steady pace of heavy sleep.
