i found a you the other day  
beneath a tarp of tattered fray  
and in so doing saved a me  
from drowning in the lonesome sea  

the you i found became a friend  
that brought my me a life to spend  
the you had but a smile so bright  
it brought my world a beaming light  

i lost my you the other day  
and where she went i cannot say  
my me became a lonely gray  
come what will and come what may
