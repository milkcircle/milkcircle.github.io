why'd you go? why'd you go...  
find my teardrops ebb and flow  

i'm dreaming of a taste so sweet  
steeped in sorrow, filled with heat  

why'd you leave? why'd you leave...  
i've mourned your loss and still i grieve  

i'm yearning for a scent so rich  
a tone to please this perfect pitch  

why'd you lie? why'd you lie...  
i've lost my other half so spry  

i'm longing for a past so cruel  
my incandescent onyx jewel...
