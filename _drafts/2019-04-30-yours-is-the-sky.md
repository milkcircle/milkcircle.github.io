yours is the sky and the starlight that shines  
the orchard and all that is savored in wines  
yours is the night and the dreams in my sleep  
the oceans that beckon these mysteries deep  

yours is the heart and the soul of the mind  
the ears for the deaf and the eyes for the blind  
yours is the courage to seek out the dark  
the flick of the switch and the flash of the spark  

yours is the wisdom to know when to speak  
to know when to stop and to know what to seek  
yours is the penchant for life and for love  
for all that is holy, from earth or above  

yours is the feeling when stars all align  
a miracle moment, subliminal sign  
i can't help but wonder how fate was designed  
will i become yours, or will you become mine?
