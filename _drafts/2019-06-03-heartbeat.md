if you listen closely to my heart  
you might hear the two words it beats  

"of course  
of course"  

of course i'm here  
of course i live  
of course i love  
of course it's you  

it's as obvious as the stars at night  
as consistent as the light of day  
as omnipresent as the twilight moon  
as joyous as children's play  

for as long as my heart continues to beat  
these two words you'll continue to hear:  

of course  
of course
