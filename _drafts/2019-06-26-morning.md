you look pure in the morning.  

the way the sun's rays softly land upon your crescent lips  
as though the day's beginning  
marks the curtain's opening  
of your story's new scene  

your unkempt hair  
sleepy eyes  
yawning stretch  
morning sighs  

have me on the edge of my seat  
as I watch your new tale unfold into dawn's embrace
