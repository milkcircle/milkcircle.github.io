late in the dark of night,  
when city lights grow dim  
the hushed calm of sleep  
quiets the restless mind's discomfort  

and in my hypnagogic state,  
i come to realize  
that i miss you most  
when you are beside me,  

and i wonder where  
the version of you i'd loved had gone,  
and who the stranger was  
that you left in her place.
