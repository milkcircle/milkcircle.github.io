in my dream  
you tell me  
this is a test,  
and only a test --  
and to win, i shall practice patience,  
and sit in discomfort, and  
wait, and wait,  
and look ahead,  
when you will find me;  

and you press your pendant in my palms,  
so that when i unclench my fist  
i see the remnants of a winged creature,  
taunting? or promising  
some form of flight to tomorrow.
