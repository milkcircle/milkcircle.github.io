sometimes the pain  
that starts  
in the heart  
will end up lodging  
itself in the brain  

it starts with just  
a thud  
in the chest  
barely a worry  
a quiver at best  

until the  
palpitations  
turn into a full-on ache  
and in the dark you're  
wide awake  

and the throbs in the heart  
form a thrombus of love  
and the heart's dying beats  
send it rushing above...  

embedding itself in  
a wedge-shaped infarct  
and the brain becomes  
irreversibly marked  

tattooed with  
the remnants  
of dwindling affection  
cradling memories of  
a fading connection  

you become mute  
and immutably still  
barely alive  
just waiting until  

your failing heart  
beats right once more  

your watershed stroke  
washes you back ashore
