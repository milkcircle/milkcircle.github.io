the skies are gray today.  

a gull outside my window flaps its wings against the wind,  
and it reminds me of a salmon furiously swimming against the current  
searching for the right place to lay its eggs and die.  

the garden upstairs is overgrown, unkempt.  
ridden with dandelions.  

i remember thinking that dandelions were pretty  
i'd pluck them and hold them up to my lips  
and gently exhale as though carefully inflating a bubble  
watching the seedlings defy gravity and fly away.  

dandelions must have coevolved around children,  
for children take so much pleasure in blowing on the florets...  
how else would they have survived otherwise?  

then i learned they were weeds  
that infest gardens and mangle the well-kept plants  
and my youthful joy was tarnished with the new understanding  
that what is fun is not always what is good for the terrace.  

i can't help but wonder,  
are you a dandelion  
or are you a rose?  

is one better than the other?  
can i not take pleasure in both?  

maybe rather than a rosegarden  
i want to cultivate an eden of dandelions instead.
