in time, she said --  
in time...  

as the years passed,  
leaves turned,  
what was color became gray  
and what was gray became ash,  

what was life became leathery,  
tough, and eroded by the  
violent beatings of dust on stone,  

and in time, as we all knew would happen one day,  
all potential went to zero,  
consumed by omnipotent entropy,  

until time itself halted,  
having nobody around to measure it.
