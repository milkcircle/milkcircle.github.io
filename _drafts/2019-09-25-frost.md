we come to a crossroads --  

one path, paved with gold,  
swarmed with infidels decked out in  
glittered dresses, selling fake ideas  
to the rich,  

then praising themselves  
for their fake ideas that contribute to nothing  
shoving each other to get paid for their  
next fake idea, all the while preening themselves  
on the outside to mask their dying insides  

the other, a path overgrown with  
burly weeds, unpaved,  
rubble prodding our weary feet...  
this path seems untouched.  

i hold my hand out to you  
kicking aside the thorns  
so you won't step in them  

the squawks of glittered men and women  
are screeching from the other side  
as i pull you close to me  

and though we can't see the end of the road  
i am certain i want nothing to do with the other side.  

there is nothing good that can come from there,  
i tell you.  

you smile, but your smile seems strained,  
and your pace slows  

and though i promise you  
that should we wish to do good upon this world  
the universe shall conspire to help us achieve it  

you peel away  
and run to join the wretches on the golden road...  

the path through these thickets is a lonely one.
