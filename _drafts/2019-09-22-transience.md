a young man with bone cancer  
draws his last breath  
in Ward 4: Oncology  
sterilized white walls his first coffin  

beside him is  
a cell phone, containing  
a folder of nature photography  
which he scrolled through  
one final time  
to show a tired medical student  
an example of how to use his DLSR.  

he is wheeled away under  
an undignified tarp  
room sprayed clean  
sheets unceremoniously changed  
for the next young patient  
this time, with thymic cancer  

a rare cancer, one which intrigues her medical team  
for about a week, until she too passes  
and her team moves on, forgetting to look up  
what they were so curious about regarding thymic cancer.  

and this assembly line of dying patients  
reminds me of you  
and your assembly line of people who love you  

the ghosts of partners past  
who had been hastily and abruptly killed  
to make way for me  
before i too was wrapped in a black tarp  
and tossed aside for the next one.
