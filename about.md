	<h1 class="pageTitle">About</h1>
	<h2>Me</h2>
	<p>I studied Chemical and Physical Biology (with a minor in Math) at Harvard College 
	from 2011 to 2015. I’m currently a first-year medical student at Harvard Medical 
	School, where I hope to learn how to reconcile my interests in writing, research, 
	entrepreneurship, and patient care in my future career. Outside of school, I like to 
	go to heavy metal concerts, play chess, read, write, and hike.</p>
	
	<h2>This Site</h2>
	<p>
	The name ‘Six Honest Serving Men’ is drawn from a poem by Rudyard Kipling about the
	importance of curiosity and youth. I treat this website as an area for me to 
	introspect, explore, and stay curious about my experiences.</p>
