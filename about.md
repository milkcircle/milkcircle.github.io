Me
===
I studied Chemical and Physical Biology (with a minor in Mathematics) at Harvard from 2011 to 2015. Afterward I moved across the Charles and began my studies at Harvard Medical School. Aside from my primary passion in medicine, I am interested in computer science, heavy metal music, chess, rock climbing, and writing.
