Me
===
I studied Chemical and Physical Biology (with a minor in Mathematics) at Harvard from 2011 to 2015. Afterward I moved across the Charles and began my studies at Harvard Medical School. Aside from my primary passion in medicine, I am interested in computer science, heavy metal music, chess, rock climbing, and writing.

This site
===
The name of this site is drawn from Rudyard Kipling’s [poem](http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_serving.htm) about curiosity and youth. This is where I deposit my thoughts and write about things that interest me.

*Err  
and err  
and err again  
but less  
and less  
and less*  
– Piet Hein
