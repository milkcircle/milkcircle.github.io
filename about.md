# About
The name 'Six Honest Serving Men' is drawn from Rudyard Kipling's 
[tribute to curiosity and inquisitiveness](http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_serving.htm). 
I treat this website as an area for me to introspect, explore, and stay curious about my experiences. 
Here I plan to write stories and reflections about the things I see and learn.

Some background about me: I studied Chemical and Physical Biology (with a minor in Math) 
at Harvard College from 2011 to 2015. I am currently a first-year medical student at Harvard 
Medical School. I am interested in learning how to reconcile my diverse interests in writing,
research, entrepreneurship, and patient care in my future career. Outside of school, I enjoy
attending heavy metal concerts, playing chess, reading, writing, and hiking.

Thanks for visiting my page, and I hope you enjoy reading my thoughts.
