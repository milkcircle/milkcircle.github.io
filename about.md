# About

About me: I studied Chemical and Physical Biology (with a minor in Math) at Harvard College
from 2011 to 2015. I'm currently a first-year medical student at Harvard Medical School, 
where I hope to learn how to reconcile my interests in writing, research, entrepreneurship,
and patient care into my future career. Outside of school, I like to go to heavy metal 
concerts, play chess, read, write, and hike.

About this website: The name 'Six Honest Serving Men' is drawn from Rudyard Kipling's 
[tribute to curiosity and inquisitiveness](http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_serving.htm). 
I treat this website as an area for me to introspect, explore, and stay curious about my experiences.
