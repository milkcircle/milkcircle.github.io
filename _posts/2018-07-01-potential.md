the pleural cavity is a potential space  
might it someday fill  
with serum? or lymph?

the pericardial sac is a potential space  
might it someday bulge  
with blood? or pus?

you and i form a potential space

might we someday effuse boredom?  
exude malignant bitter thoughts?  
tamponade from pent-up frustration?  
erupt with silent purulent rage?

or like the linings of the lungs  
gently pull each other close  
bound together by  
an almost  
imperceptible  
vacuum?
