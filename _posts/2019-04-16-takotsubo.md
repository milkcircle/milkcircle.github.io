midnight snaps like a rubber band  
and the Sun dives into the water.  

the day becomes pitch black  
but there are no lights to lift the dark.  

my pericardial windowshades close  
the shutters to my soul  

and the pleura drowns  
in sudden sorrow.  

there is a distant moan  
signaling the death of a deep-sea creature,  
its ink wrapping its legs like a choking womb.  

and i am left gasping,  
gasping,  
gasping,  

wondering  

is this as good as it gets?
