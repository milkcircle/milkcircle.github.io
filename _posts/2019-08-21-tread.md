rain lightly upon her, Sky  
cover her in gentle mist  
and blanket the horizon with London gray clouds  
just as she likes it.  

tread softly beneath her, Earth  
bloom tender flowers by her path  
and surround her home with bright green grass  
just as she deserves.  

gust quietly upon her, Wind  
and nudge her subtly on her way  
brush faintly upon the roseate cheeks  
as i would have, were i a character in her play.  

rustle silently near her, Tree  
and spread thy roots patulously below her feet  
sing her a scented reminder  
that i am there in spirit, i've not gone away.
