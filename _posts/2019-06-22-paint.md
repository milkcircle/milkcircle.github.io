we are violent artists, you and i  

and when we share a canvas  
our paintbrushes turn to warring spears  
and we throw crimson hues ruthlessly upon the felt  
until the pigments bleed into our skin  
imbuing us with the red-hot passion  
that foments continuously until our bodies collide in battle.  

and when our crusade is over  
all we are left with  
is the black and blue that permeates the undercling of our fabric.
