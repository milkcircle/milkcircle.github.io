kill your darlings, they said.  

i stared into your galaxy eyes  
and floated amongst your Jupiter moons  
hoping that i wouldn't have to shatter those rings  
that adorned your alluring iris.  

we swam in a glass of ros√©;  
i felt your intoxicating scent permeate my soul  
and my tears formed dewdrops upon your dianthus lips.  

kill your darlings.  

i hewed your sturdy fir, sending it through fire and flames  
as you deserved nothing less than a bow that's been through hell and back;  
and heaving the weight of my heart upon the stake i made,  
i strung the bow with a lock of my own hair  
plucking it like a harp to ease you.  

my mind's perfect speech trickled out of my quivering mouth  
in spurts of choked up phonemes, as i aimed at your heart  

but before i could send my arrow screaming toward you  

Eros shot us both.
