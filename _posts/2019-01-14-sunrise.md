when the sun rises  
the suffocating dark brightens its hue at a snail's pace  
so if you're not paying attention  
you might not even notice the new day  

until the yellowthroat shrills its morning alarm  
the overnight winds fade to a soft whisper  
the sleepy suburbs stretch and yawn to the cyan-amber skies  
and the thoughts of you give way...  

and my modern misanthropic incubus  
opens up its eyes to us  

and the bitter coffee grounds  
melt away those nightmare sounds  

and I, though transiently scarred  
recalling Eloisa to Abelard  

pull the curtains back to let  
the light combat the threat  

for there the brightly shining morning  
banishes my midnight mourning  

and the heat the twilight stole  
comes back again to warm my soul
