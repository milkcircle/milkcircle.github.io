how will she judge her life's success  
or rather, by which measure?  
her purity of character  
or her acts of unearned pleasure?  

how will she weigh the ones she hurt?  
will she ignore her deeds?  
will she forget the ones she's used  
so that she could succeed?  

will money be her metric?  
for she's never felt debt's strain  
will she continue feeding  
all the vanity in her veins?  

her eyes on the horizon  
she overlooks the sea  
and with her heedless ego, she  
rewrites her history

let the rite of spring  
chase the winter nights away  
pray the winds of reason  
wipe the skies of all the gray

may the sighted world  
see what Tiresias sees  
to replace their worldly sins  
and relieve their heart's unease...
