when, hostile to hostile  
we force words through  
seethed lips, and  
in the waiting  
there is the scent of dread...  
that space between  
silence and rage  
is the space i live for,  
the quiet friction of work  
and frame of mind, and  
it's those gray clouds which  
give rise to the rain which  
feeds the green and  
births the petrichor and  
eases us back to calm.
