in my dreams  
i can touch the moon  
and switch off the sun.  

in my dreams  
i can float in air  
and bring you along, too.  

and i'd take you on  
a first class ride  
to follow the birds  
and kiss the stars.  

and we'd chase the light  
during these barren nights  
for it's always a new horizon  

somewhere far away.
