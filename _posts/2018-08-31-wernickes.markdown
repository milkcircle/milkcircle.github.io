it was dark morning when  
curtain over my eyes like night  
made me like a bah bah bah baby  

she next to me her eyes saucer-wide  
her voice radio static sstztstztzzss i couldn’t understand  

her name over and over and over record player  
alien tongue and the whole world aliens and  
i couldn’t understand  

she couldn’t understand, understand,  
stand me  

an ocean apart like genesis tower  
my brain flooded drown can’t breathe can’t understand  
i babble like babel like a baby babble  

and heart pound heavy i babble  
she shushes shhhhh  
her lips like silk soft cover mine i stop babbling  

even in aphasia love needs no words
