the hourglass of this eternity  
comes in color-changing leaves  
and when rosepetals brown with  
aging wines, and light refracts  
from fallen snow, the seasons  
call from the settled ashes a  
stretching phoenix free.  

the scythe of chronos slices  
your fiery images from this  
neurodegenerative amnesic  
blank  

and though there is myoclonus  
there is no grief, there is no grief  

i bandage your broken memories  
as best as i can, but through  
this lachrymose curtain i can  
only sense your wintergreen oils  
as i wonder to myself if your  
spearmint frost is really a form  
of burning, and i wonder whether  
i am the dying embers.
