there's a solace  
in melting snow  

a fractal among millions  
crafted by circumstance  
like we once were  

which, landing in a whitened bank,  
lets its perfection go, edges  
withering into its brethren's weathered embrace  

unseen, unheard, unfelt, untouched  
an ephemeral gem  
once here, and gone again.
