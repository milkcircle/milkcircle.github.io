homeless and decrepit and soiled, he  
appeared in the icu one day,  
febrile and delirious  
and, breathing hard,  
collapsed --  

making room 110 his home for the next month  

a septic body in a toxic life  
confined within sterile walls  

the day i met him, he died  
after hours of kussmauling  
eyes glued shut but  
even then, clearly in unconscious agony  

and on his way out  
on a squeaky stretcher under a tarp  
there was a moment of silence  

for an elderly homeless man,  
name unknown,  
encoded in the system as a mr henry alaska  
age presumed 70s  
no contact information  

and there i stood  
screaming silently in my head  
"you mattered, you mattered, you mattered"  
while his temporary home was sprayed,  
mopped, and swept clean for its next inhabitant.
