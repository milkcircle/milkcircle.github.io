a theremin weeps in the corner of the room  
while the hi-hats shudder in sighs  

the flute sends a flutter into the air  
and the tuba wails at the skies  

a lonely bass sends his heavy hello  
and the cello voices his pain  

while the clarinet murmurs its rumors to spare  
and the strings swell to mimic the rain  

and the orchestra pays its somber respect  
to the man who waves his baton  

and they urge the weary and broken conductor  
to carry on, sir: carry on
