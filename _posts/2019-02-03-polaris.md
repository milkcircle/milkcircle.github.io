Concentrate now, beloved!  
This one is tricky.  

1.  
Were it not for  
the Jigsaw  
the light blue, *en plein air* snapshot of  
the Bridges Burned --  

2.  
Nobody else might have noticed  
the phoenix aflame, somewhere hidden deep,  
deep,  
buried or drowned beneath the once-solid  
Bridge.  

3.  
Were Cain and Abel a tragedy,  
a necessity,  
or both?  

4.  
You might wonder why -- if polar opposites attract --  
are electrons dispersed in a hesitant cloud  
around a nucleus compact?  

5.  
Maybe they've internalized  
Holofernes' gory end  
and decided against it for themselves,  
instead choosing to hide  
from Heisenberg's prying eyes.

6.  
Sutures must be cut  
if they are to bind together.  
Slums must be demolished  
for highways to be built.  

7.  
And in the end,  
only in the very, very end,  
do the Beautiful and the Righteous  
come together to give rise to  
The Virtuous.
