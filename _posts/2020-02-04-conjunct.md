silence dwindles and dangles from the musty air  
like a necklace of broken dreams,  
our mouths opening and closing without sound,  
gulping air as one might with water,  
when he's drowning.  

this is the night of all nights,  
when the lady of the river, waves swelling with the tide  
remembers the faces of those she's drowned,  
and mother earth remembers the names of those she's buried,  

and in the dark of dying there is a beacon of dim light,  
a reflection maybe? or actually light, nobody can yet tell  
that the earthworms follow, where the blind train their eyes  
and it's lighting the way to the miracle of Togetherness, which  

even in dead silence, among the rust and mildew of the ev'ning  
arises intertwined as thick and impenetrable roots of a tree called Ardor.
