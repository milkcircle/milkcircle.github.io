you are thunder  
that which portends  
the blackened sky  
and roaring winds  

the clouds asunder  
part their ways  
to carpet bomb  
those pebbled roads  

and force us under  
wrathful gales  
which shake our cores  
and stuff our lungs  

it makes me wonder  
whether the hail  
will ever soften  
to gentler rains...
