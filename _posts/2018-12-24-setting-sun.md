the scorching sun sets  
and announces its departure  
with red-orange curtains,  

leaving my face tingling raw  
and my cheeks flushed whiskey-pink.  

your smooth hands are  
a cool soothing lotion  
to my sun-kissed skin  

and your gentle touch  
awakens the same shiver  
and blood-rush  
once kindled by the flames of the evanescent inferno.
