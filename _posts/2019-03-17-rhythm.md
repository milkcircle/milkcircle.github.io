your lashes openandclose  
and my heart beatsandbeats  
to the rhythm of your quiet inandexhales.  

the oceans between us pulse  
with the silent crashes  
of our exhausted waves  

and black caws fill the sunset dying sky  

to remind me yet again  
that another day has passed  
with our thoughts separated by the distance and time  
of a thousand lonely and unwelcome moonlit years.
