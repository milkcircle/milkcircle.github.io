Wouldst thou choose  
That blameless vestal's lot --  
The world forgetting,  
By the world forgot?  

And, once freed  
Thy heav'ly burdened mind  
To fall subject  
To errors of past kind?

Or venture forth  
Thro' fiery depths of hell --  
And, once emerged,  
Bid those throes farewell...  

To live impaired,  
Whilst knowing days are numbered --  
But truly *live*,  
A bruised soul unencumbered?
