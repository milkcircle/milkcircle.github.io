join me  
and we'll go off to some secluded place  
with nobody around  

a place where even birds chirp in whispers  
and ants tiptoe quietly  

where the wind will hold its breath for us  
and the trees will stand still  

and in this utter quiet  
you and i will expand our lungs  
and make nary a peep  

and maybe, just maybe  
you'll hear my heartbeat  
and i'll hear yours too   
and we'll hear the lub-dubs converge  
into a single beating drum  

that matches the rhythm of our free spirits  
where our vitality matches our systole  
and our paroxysms end in a silent diastolic sigh
