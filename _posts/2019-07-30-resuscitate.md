we are full code  
and i whisper to myself  
a silent rhythm  
to keep us alive  
as your heart stops beating for us.  

and through cracked ribs  
and hemorrhaging lungs  
and the quiet terror  
of softly dying pulses  

i give everything i have  
for the miniscule chance  
to restore our spontaneous heartbeat.
