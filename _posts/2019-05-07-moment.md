the moment we were born the world held its breath  
and in so doing its lungs grew and grew  
filling with the air that sustained us.  

the moment we collided the world clapped its thunder  
and its spark shocked our hearts, defibrillating our  
hormonal alternans.  

the moment we died the world ruptured  
like a broken heart whose ventricles had become so jaded  
it could no longer contain the love i gave to you.
