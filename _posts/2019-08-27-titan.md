atlas  
shouldered  
the weight of the sky  
until the weight of the sky  
buried atlas  

and on his way down  
into the meat of the ground  
said he...  
"at last,  
at last  

to meet  
the guardian  
of the gates  
of hell  
and show him  
a job well done"  

and the weight of the sky  
buried atlas alive  
and he melted into the stars  

which is why  
there's no longer  
anybody here  
to shoulder  
the weight of the sky  

oh...  
can you feel it,  
the weight of the sky...
