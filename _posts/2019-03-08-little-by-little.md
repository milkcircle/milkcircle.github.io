little by little, big by big  
    from your heart's flask i take a swig  
one by one and three by three  
    i tap your shoulder, dance with me  

up the hall and down the river  
    your lips upon mine tremble-quiver  
here and there and through and through  
    i whisk you home just me and you  

yin and yang and you and i  
    hold each other eye to eye  
sweet your words and sweet your heart  
    your beauty is a work of art  

east by south and north by west  
    i'll follow you a doting guest  
now and then and here and there  
    a never-ending handheld pair
