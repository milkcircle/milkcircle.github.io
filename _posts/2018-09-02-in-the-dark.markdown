when we're in the dark  
you are my map  
my fingers search for a spinous process  
and palpate the divots in your back  
until they land upon the warmth of your latissimi

the gentle curve of your thoracic spine  
guides my hands toward the waist  
where, my palms the weary travelers  
quietly rest upon your hips  

and with my arms finally in familiar territory  
my body catches up  
until you and i collapse together  
victorious  
home at last  
back into the light of day
