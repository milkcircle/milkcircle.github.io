love of man, of  
ordinary homo sapiens, recognizing  
in amusement that in the end, the wholly  
unremarkable individual finds  
joy in the littlest acts  
of giving, caring,  
of owning a small piece of the  
hearts of his dust-particle brethren  
and that the only thing that matters  
is that their instantaneous flashes of  
existence overlap, so that  
they each can see the other's  
light if but for a brief moment  
before collapsing into dust and  
time disintegrates the transient memory  
of anything having ever been.
