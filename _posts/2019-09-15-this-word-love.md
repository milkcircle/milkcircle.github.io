last year  
in response to the  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheapening of certain words in the English language  
as evidenced by our muttering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i love these shoes  
and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i love you  
in the same breath

the government decided to limit us to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two  
instances of the word "love"  
in a day.  

it took a while to get used to.  

i no longer love the music i listen to  
nor my favorite foods  
nor the puppies i see on the lawns  

i no longer love the wind in my hair  
nor the poetry i read  
nor the feeling of dewdrop grass under my feet  

no...  
i saved up all those chances  
to use the golden word  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love  

and stored them in a jar  
in a quiet dark cupboard  
behind my secret stash of cookies  
and the most expensive bottles of oil i have  

in anticipation for the day  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you come back  
at which point i will retrieve the hidden jar  

and shower you with the breathless iloveyous  
i've saved up over the year  

and adorn you with the precious linguistic jewelry  
i've smithed for you.
