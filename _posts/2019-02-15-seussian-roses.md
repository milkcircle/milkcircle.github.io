most roses are red  
most violets are blue  
but would they by any other color  
not smell just as sweet to you?  

for could you imagine  
anything duller  
than a floral arrangement  
of a single color?

and what else is love  
but a varied bouquet  
of assorted experiences  
of good and bad days?

and what could be worse  
than a monochrome life  
void of kaleidoscopic  
pleasure and strife?  

i promise this to  
the one i adore  
roses and violets  
and tulips and more  

and i know that we'll both  
have our ups and our downs  
and our own special mix  
of smiles and frowns  

and even if my roses  
aren't perfectly red  
i hope you'll accept  
these other shades instead  

and even though my violets  
aren't always cyan  
i'll plant you more flowers  
wherever i can  

and when i'm out of flowers  
i'll pour you some wine  
and knit you a crown  
out of dandelions and twine  

and we'll witness these colors  
forming our story's rainbow  
and sit back and watch  
our rosegarden grow  

for roses are red  
and violets are blue  
but i've got an orchard  
special for you
