what does it matter --  
what i eat in the morning?  
or the light blaring through  
the cover of cumulus curtains  
in the chill of the morning?  

what does it matter --  
what i do, how i wander  
the silent schooltime streets  
where the retired elderly  
wave their resigned goodbyes  
to another passing day?

when there is a desideratum --  
a sole indispensable thing,  
no degree of sun, or warmth, or  
purpose, or time, or faith, or  
hope, or distraction, or sleep,  

no food, nor drink, nor  
mindless television drones, nor  
screaming music, nor hobby, nor  
art, nor sport --  

will lift this mask of anhedonia  
which drives this husk of a body's  
perpetual journey toward  
an intangible, unattainable  
desideratum.
