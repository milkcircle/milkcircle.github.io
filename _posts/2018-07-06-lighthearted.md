you’re ranexa to my angina  
lanoxin to my flutter  
the intensol to my amyloid  
the dopa to my shock

you’re the toprol to my afib  
the mag to my torsades  
the rythmol to my vtach  
the pacer to my block

but even as my pharmacy  
you cannot save my heart  
from shattering to pieces  
whenever we’re apart
