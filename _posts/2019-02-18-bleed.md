i am perfectly aware  
that blood is valuable.  

after all,  
i was born  
unable to make any blood  
that actually works.  

and i am perfectly aware  
of the shortages around the world.  

and i know that  
there exists no other golden honey  
that can rejuvenate and revitalize me  
like blood,  

and that i'd best hang on to all that i can.  

so what does it mean  
when i find myself  
willing to bleed  
for you?
