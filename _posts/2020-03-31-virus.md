cough: the gunpowder of this war,  
and contact: its firearm  

weather-beaten bodies,  
aged with experience,  
the first victims  
of inaudible airborne missiles  

and -- masked, uniformed --  
the weary shuffle of broken healers  
faith teetering but facade unbroken  
guarding shattered gates,  

grace fills the voids  
left untouched by virus,  
muffling the cannons until  
sweet silence illuminates those neon halls
