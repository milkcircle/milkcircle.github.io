she knelt in the soil, dropping seeds in their new homes. i ask,  
how long will you wait for the sprouts? we looked at the cracked dirt,  
and a dry breeze rustled brown paper leaves. there's a faint scatter of  
bouncing sand, and a quiet after the wind fades. oh, she says, eyeing the  
pockmarks in the ground. the roots are yet to take. with you, i'd wait forever.
