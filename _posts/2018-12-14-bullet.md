they told me that  
she was a bullet dodged  
thank God, they said.  
you need to celebrate!  

look at all those signs  
think about the future  
what could've happened to you  
if things were different?  

you would have been hurt  
ruined, used up,  
been left out to rot.  

she's gone on now  
to ruin someone else. you're saved!  
you've surely dodged a bullet.  

they told me this  
smiling and sipping their sparkling wines  
laughing in joy at my life renewed  

not noticing the bloodstain  
seeping through my shirt  
or the shrapnel embedded in my chest  

not noticing me  
slowly  
bleed  
out
