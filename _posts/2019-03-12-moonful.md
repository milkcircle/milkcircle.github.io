love is like a moonful sea  
(laughter yours so sorrowly)  
fuller than a kingdom free  
nor emptier than a hymnful key  

love is like the starful sky  
(tearful mine so whispershy)  
taller than the cloudship high  
nor smaller than the commonfly  

love is yours my tender sweet  
(ragedom ours so charged with heat)  
stiller yet than birdsong tweets  
nor breathful more than sighs discreet
