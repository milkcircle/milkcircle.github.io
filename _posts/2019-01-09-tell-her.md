*to be sung to the tune of ["Tell Her This"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0we7NqFH_Zw) by Del Amitri*  

Tell her I bid her adieu  
Tell her I found somebody new  
I won't forget the times we had  
All the good times and the bad  
My love for her was ironclad  

Tell her I wish her the best  
Tell her I hope that the rest  
Of her time is filled with love  
Fingers crossed from up above  
That he fits her like a glove  

Tell her I'll stop wondering why  
Tell her I won't let life pass me by  
She's found the one to treat her fine  
And I've too finally found mine  
Let the world realign  

Tell her good morning and good night  
Tell her these poems that I write  
Are filled with cryptic love and care  
And all the things I cannot bear  
To spill out in the open air...  

And tell her nothing if not this  
I won't mistake our time for bliss  
But still our time I'll surely miss
