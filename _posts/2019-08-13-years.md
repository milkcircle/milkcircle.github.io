said the boy  
"i'm bored, i'm bored"  

said i  
"me too, me too"  

said the boy  
"i want to leave"  

and i  
"you're not alone"  

said the boy  
"sometimes i wonder why  
i'm so much different than my friends"  

and so i sat  
and looked at him  
and said in earnest  
to the child  

"sometimes i wonder too  
why you and i are always here  

and why we cannot be out there  
to feel the sun and breathe the air"  

and then i looked him in the eyes  
and told him what i think is true  

"i think that you are here  
to show them all what you can do  
for only someone as strong as you  
can go through all that you've been through..."  

*inspired by a conversation  
with a young hospitalized boy  
whose age in experience  
far exceeds his age in years*
