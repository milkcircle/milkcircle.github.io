your succulent tulips  
taste like ephemeral rosehips  
and drift like swirling smoke  
into the forest oak  

and though your cactus thorn  
shouts the loss i used to mourn  
through the thickets i will wade  
so your memory won't fade...  

O efflorescent juniper  
i will no longer cherish her

O bishop dahlia belvedere  
you will not find me weeping here
