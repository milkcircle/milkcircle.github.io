you used to be synesthesia --  
a layer of watercolor on top of  
these muted days  

holding you was a light sapling green  
and the way our lips touched was a brilliant ocean blue  
and when you smiled, i saw  
little zigzags sprouting across my visual fields  
as though i was noticing the electric field  
emanating from you.  

talking to you was red  
it started pink, like the shade of lipstick you wore  
when we first met  
and grew dark and magenta with passion  
as we devolved into breathless laughter  
and breathless sighs.  

sleeping was a calm sunset orange  
waking was an energetic poppy yellow  
and eating --  
eating with you was a sudden rainbow after  
a mauve, tired day.  

you used to be synesthesia,  
a canvas of color, a sensory palette -- 

missing you is gray.
