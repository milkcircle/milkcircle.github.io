the gifts of  
first breath,  
first words,  
first steps,  

of unconditional  
circumstance-independent  
support, sturdy legs  
of a broken stool,  

quiet forgiveness,  
mental and emotional  
fortitude, companion tears,  

defense against  
the world's brutal elements,  
lessons through unsung  
acts of heroism,  

are by nature  
underappreciated,  
but deserve the recognition  
of a thousand doves
