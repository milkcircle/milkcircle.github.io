he jumps, and  
cracks his  
spine,  

myocardium  
as stunned as  
the onlookers,  

gloved hands  
prying open  
his broken chest,  

grasping, pumping  
his broken heart,  

howls of despair  
voicing the  
drunken pain  

he moments before  
felt tearing through  
his unfocussed,  
torn-up mind.  

to the teen  
i've never met:  

i am sorry the world  
broke you  
even before you  
leapt  

and killed you  
before you died.
