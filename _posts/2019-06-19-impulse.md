the collision between two objects can create a beautiful thing.  
you and i are *kintsugi*  
a product of the love and heat crafted by a red-hot kiln  
then shattered.  

we were fractured by the impulse of an elastic collision  
stretched so thin it snapped in two  
and blown apart like a gunshot vase  
spilling all the liquid gold it ever held  

and we're left to pick up the pieces  
rekindling the smoldering fire  
in hopes that the melted lacquer that's forming between us  
can reglue the vessel i had once molded for you
