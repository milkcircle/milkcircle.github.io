I, inexperienced journeyman, during an evening desert ride  
Happened upon a moonlit visage of hardened gold  
A gallop more brought forth a statuesque outline, a ceramic shell  
A stunning refined silhouette in the foreground of a barren wasteland.  
Mirage? or Truth? I could not yet decipher  
Until, slowed to trots, I approached the pristine figure.  
Breath held deep until pleurisy yielded a sigh  
As I discovered that what was beauty from afar  
Was naught but warped remnants of growth  
The wooden remains, once engulfed by fiery flames  
Given way to ash, a static, withered trunk of lost life  
And -- hopes dashed, chest burning with flame extinguished,  
squinted eyes yearning for the flaxen frame my virgin mind envisioned --  
I urged my steed, "Ride on."
