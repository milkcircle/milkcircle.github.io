there's a space  
words cannot fill,  
in whose hushed place  
i sow with food,  
company, promises,  
the silent reassurance  
of trust, worth,  
enoughness,  

and the patience  
and hope that come  
spring and summer,  
tranquility takes  
root, blossoms, and  
fills the nooks and crannies  
my words couldn't reach  
with warmth of a million  
soft syllables.
