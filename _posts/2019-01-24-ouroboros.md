my clenched fists  
by my heartbeats  
my eyes shut tight  
i feel my shuddered breaths  
on the knees i hold to my  
anginal chest  

i am crouched  
on the ground  
and i can see  
every blade of my carpet  
and the edge  
where my blood  
meets the floor  

there's a roar in my ears  
like silent thunder  
or a dry waterfall  
and it masks  
my actual screams  
so it sounds so  
deafeningly quiet  

and in this fetal position  
i wonder whether  
newborns know  
they are being born  
into a damned hell  

and whether they  
will be so fortunate  
to find the way out  
like i'm about to.
