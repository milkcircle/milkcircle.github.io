at water's edge, the ferryman's cry  
pierced the beaconed moonlit sky  

and, steady, lo! mine eyes transfixed  
upon the blackened river Styx  

i paid the bargeman's sinful toll  
and stepped upon the jagged shoal  

for Charon spake his wicked hest  
the mournful swamp's invited guest  

i waded through that viscous brine  
and faced a long-eroded sign...  

"Sic demum lucos Stygis et  
regna invia vivis aspicies  

Anchisa generate deum  
certissimia proles..."  

a maudlin lachrymose farewell  
before we braced ourselves for hell
