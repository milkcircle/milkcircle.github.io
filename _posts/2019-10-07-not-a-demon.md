when is a demon not a demon?  
when you treat her as an angel  
when the dark of her heart  
warms to the light of your songs  
and the wrongs of her past  
right themselves for you  
when her quiet words  
sing brightness to your ears  
and her soft hands  
melt the callus on your skin  
and her presence fills  
the vacuum in your day  
and her absence  
suffocates like  
the crushing  
weight of  
endless  
night
