in secret,  
dying flames  
melt the final  
inches of their  
waning wicks,  
scent subtly  
shifting from  
sweet wax to  
scorched ash,  

and in the final  
dim sputters of  
heat, one wonders  

whether they mattered at all,  
if no-one commemorates the embers  

and if no-one recalls  
the festivities  
the candles initially represented.
