nothing changes for the devil.  

the world may burn  
a thunderous red,  
and acid may rain  

creatures and men  
may die, of  
physical or emotional  
causes,  

or of the  
tiny imperceptible  
consequences  
of serpent-tongue lies  

and in the  
smoldering aftermath,  

nothing changes for the  
grinning devil.
