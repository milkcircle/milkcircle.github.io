i -- parched in desert thirst -- wander upon  
a crouched blind man,  
who holds his brains in his hands.  

i ask him,  
"Sir,  
why carry your brain as you do  
in this desert heat?"  

he stares with milky eyes toward me  
and says:  
"my mind is filled to the brim  
with endless sorrow  
and i aim to remove it."  

and proceeds to take another bite  
from the already moth-eaten cortex.
