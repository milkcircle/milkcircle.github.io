to climb -- because the challenge is there  
to feel the wind and breathe the air  
to feel the earth beneath your feet  
and rest where skin and soil meet  

to leave your mark upon the world  
with heart on sleeve, and fists unfurled --  
your impact has no bounds, no end  
so climb onward, dear friend  

climb on
