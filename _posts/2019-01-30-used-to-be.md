here i am  
here i will be  
here you were  
here you used to be  
one day  
i won't be  
and i'll used to be  
but when that time comes  
i care  
will still be  
i care  

but when you are  
became you were  
became you used to be  
you care  
became you cared  
became you used to care  
became you don't care  
and you remember  
became you forget  
and you think  
became you thought  

and what is there  
is what was there  
will one day be  
what used to be  

and blue i am  
and blue i'll be  
when you  
no longer think  
of me
