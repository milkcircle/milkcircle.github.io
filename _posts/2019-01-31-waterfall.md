there's a waterfall in my dreams where we'd always go  
where the rush of water mirrored my rush of endorphins  
and anticipation roared in my ears  

and we, soaked in river tears,  
would share our drowned laughter no-one else hears  

behind cascading curtains,  
we'd prepare for the debut of our epic play  
and dress in costumes we bought each other  
waiting for the drapes to part  

for a moment we could act our pretend future  
to a sea of silent life  
and end our scenes to the waves' thunderous applause  

i went to our waterfall alone today  
and saw that our theatre has eroded away  

our quiet, enchanted audience  
replaced by faint ripples of water  
lapping against runnel rocks  

like echoes of a distant tide  
of what is now a river dried...
