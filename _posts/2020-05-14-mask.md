though we both are masked,  
i see you through  
your weary eyes --  
the rasps in your sorrowed voice  
suggest a story greater than words,  
and the worn skin around your  
reddened eyes  
portends the news i need to share  

but before i tell you of your  
new rare cancer  
(which had the whole department  
scratching its head for a week)  
let me stand silent with you a while,  

and, though our hands cannot touch,  
and we cannot exchange smiles,  
and i still get you mixed up with room 23b  
because everyone's in the same mask and gown,  
let me hear about your wife,  
who calls every day  

your son, whose restaurant makes the world's best clam bake,  
where you offered to get me a reservation,  

your dog, more arthritic than  
anyone else in the aging family,  
who still runs to the door every morning  
to greet you.  

these masks may  
cover our faces, but they  
do not hide our humanity,  
and our words, not our appearances,  
tell our story,  

so let me stand here and hear about you  
before the sky splinters, breaks, and falls,  
and i must end your world with my news.
