drunk! thy veritable lips lupine  
like licorice liqueur atop mine like wine  
imbibe deep this toxin thine  
obscure those thorny thoughts Devine  

my nerves a drink shaken, stirred  
sensing absence, those words unheard  
a teenage wasteland, thoughts absurd  
quick! a sip for a world blurred  

may it shroud a mind disturbed  
and yield a future less perturbed  

may it haze those thoughts unwanted,  
assuage those pressing passions haunted
