the windows clatter with  
winter winds and rumbling train tracks,  
and the impatient car horns shriek in  
major thirds, eliciting a husky shout  
from a guttural worndown voice  
several floors below  

and on the streets in the dimming sunlight  
a weary mother holds an infant in her arms,  
a toddler waddling by her side, hands held,  
the troupe scurrying past the destitute and sick  
and the unsteady drunks traipsing past them,  

and from above, where i stand watching them,  
the worn-out throngs and their ordinary steps  
form a deep, precise, and delicate choreography --  
a dance painted on the streets of the bustling city  
led by the invisible thread of poignant life  
and the story of individuals as part of the whole.
