if entropy is the measure  
of multiplicity in a system  
that which allows for  
the greatest denominator of arrangements  

then my affinity for you is  
entropic beyond repair  

as a pool of endless waves  
which follows the high tide  
into the moon's pull  

a reminder that an object's mass  
and an object's volume  
are not necessarily interrelated  

because in your petite and singular figure  
lies a pull so strong  
it draws me in as a dying star draws in light  
from every corner  

you are what constitutes  
the beauty in the physics of a system  
and you are what belies  
the complexity of a universe  
reflected in your endless eyes.
