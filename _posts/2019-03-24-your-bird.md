your bird arrives from the land of serenity today  
and from its daylong flight from the kingdom of happiness  
follows a contrail of foreign gray tears  

your bird perched upon a gold-flaked roof  
basking in the glow of roped-off royalty  
before departing for the gentrified city of crude tycoons  

your bird returns to its origin nest --  
well-traveled and well-seasoned, and head hung high --  
swooping into the arms of the dropout hawk-catcher  

with its feet dipped in gold and its silky-preened feathers  
forgetting its most important origin story:  
that it is just a bird  

and that it left its nestlings long ago for the empty promise of  
flying its way into the status of a gold-adorned eagle  
leaving its starving beaks to roost and melt in the hot summer sun.
