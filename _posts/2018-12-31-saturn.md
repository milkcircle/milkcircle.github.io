when two planets collide  
the impact of the two gargantuan bodies creates a force  
unfathomably large  
and the cataclysmic event is felt by everything in its vicinity for years and years.  

you sat in your Saturn throne, wearing those emerald rings visible by the naked eye  
and when i gazed upon your body  
yours was the brightest in the night sky  
unmatched by even Sirius  

i made your emerald stones into rings  
smithed them with my calloused hands  
upon the flames of the Sun  
until the jewelry was fit for even queens  

crafted the metal with rods of steel  
until my fingers were bloodied  
and the crimson liquid leaked into the furious stone  
garnet streaks among the jade green gems  

but you hid my gifts beneath your trenchcoat  
the brilliant glow masked by the blackout cloth  
that you used to carry the gravedug treasures you stole  

the vacuum you made, the black hole you formed  
sucked the light and the life of me and my work  
into a pinpoint smaller than the origin universe  

when we collided  
the sky shattered into onyx shrapnel  
sending shards of sharpened stone toward my heart  
digging daggers into my wrists  
flooding the room with the same blood imbued into those hidden jewels you wore  

tears and crimson rivers mixing like rain upon the Red Sea  
raindrops dropping bombs onto the soft sands  
winds whispering softly in your deafened ears  
asking whether you held him like you held me  
explored his tributaries like you explored mine  
felt his pounding heart like you did mine  
loved him as you loved me  

and when i wielded the sword and shield i smithed  
with the same steel i surrendered to your soul  
for a final bloody battle to the end  
splinters of stone cutting criss-crosses into my skin  
i couldn't help but wonder  

was it worth it?
