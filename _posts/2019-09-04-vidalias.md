the gentle slice through  
layers and layers,  
revealing the greens and whites  
in your spiced soul  

liberates the vidalia's inner bitterness  
which empties these lachrymose ducts...  

reminding us why  
things that are worth having  
are often things worth shedding tears for,  

and that the most complex dishes  
sometimes need the sharpest of onions.
