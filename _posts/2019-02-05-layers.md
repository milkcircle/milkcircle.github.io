we stood beside the luxury car  
its tinted windows  
hiding its marveled driver  
whose tinted eyes  
hid his secret scandals  

and you sighed,  
"wouldn't it be nice to live like that?"  

at first i thought you were talking about the car.  

but as time went on  
[you shed your skin](https://aaroncheng.me/poetry/2018/12/09/whiterobe-sheepskin-demoness.html)  
its original sheen  
now a pile of dead flakes surrounding you  

and your core  
barely resembled what i'd known before  

some people grow more beautiful  
the more layers you peel back.  
some of them hide secret jewels  
inside their soul-cases.  

others  
grow darker and darker  
the deeper you dig.  
until at their core  
what remains  
is dust  
or worse.  

and everyone knows  
what lives in their center  
whether it be a pearl  
[or a demon](https://aaroncheng.me/poetry/2018/12/16/demons-infest-this-world.html).  

and some have the desire and capacity to change it.  

we stood beside the luxury car  
your eyes piercing through the tinted surfaces  
yearning for the [onyx core](https://aaroncheng.me/poetry/2018/12/31/saturn.html)  

and on the way home  
[you threw me into the sea](https://aaroncheng.me/poetry/2018/11/24/sink.html)  
since you felt i was getting a little too close  
to the secrets you were hiding.  

[and only after i drowned](https://aaroncheng.me/poetry/2019/01/01/crypt-4.html)  
could you finally breathe your sigh of relief.
