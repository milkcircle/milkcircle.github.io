slow!  
how succulents grow  
and reach toward the window  
as though to feel the soft winds blow  
and the heat of the sun aglow...  

(and you are the sun, my dear  
whose cozy rays i can feel from here  
whose shine i wish would last all year  
whose light brightens this atmosphere)  

and as a flower will bend toward  
the sun -- so i bend toward you, my young adored:  
and as a flower carves a path of its own accord  
so do i wish you -- my dear -- would come aboard...
