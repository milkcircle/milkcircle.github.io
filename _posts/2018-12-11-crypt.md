Have you kept the keep-  
sakes that you tossed into the heap?  
Don't you know the past can change  
Those mem'ries rearrange?  

Won't you go and take a peek  
At those notes that made me weak  
Or will they lie forevermore  
Concealed inside that padlocked drawer?

Modify my history, reverse her story too  
If the past can always change then what is really true?
