In supervised statistical learning, a way of approaching a case where categorical training data results from a mixture of multiple low-variance Gaussian distributions (where individual means are themselves Gaussian-distributed) is via k-nearest neighbor modeling.  

In particular, the $$k$$-nearest neighbor fit for $$\hat{Y}(x) = \frac{1}{k}\sum\limits_{x_i\in N_k(x)}{y_i}$$, where $$N_k(x)$$ is defined as the $$k$$ points that exist in the neighborhood of $$x$$.  

Suppose that $$N_k(x)$$ corresponds to those $$k$$ points nearest to $$x$$ for each $$x_i$$ as defined by Euclidean distance. When $$k=1$$, the resultant clusters can be mapped onto a two-dimensional diagram to show a Voronoi diagram!

# Voronoi diagram
library(ggvoronoi)

# Create data
x_coord <- sample(1:200, 100)
y_coord <- sample(1:200, 100)

# Define points
points <- data.frame(x_coord, y_coord)

ggplot(points,aes(x_coord,y_coord)) +

  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
