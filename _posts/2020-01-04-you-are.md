for those who carry  
a mountain upon those  
torn and weary shoulders  
who, walking with the weight of the world  
sink deeper and deeper  
barefoot, into the dense soil  
i say unto you:  
love those who hate you  
and forgive those who cannot live righteously  
for they carry a burden far heavier than yours,  
though they may not know it...  
share the weight of their universe  
forgive, but never forget.
