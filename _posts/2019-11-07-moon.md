do not look at the moon --  
for the sharpness of its point  
might bring to mind  
the sharpness of your words  
and the roundness of its surface  
may summon the images  
of the soft, subtle curves  
that quietly border your skin  

and the luminescence of  
the lunar reflection  
is a reminder of  
the light that once  
paved the way to life  
before it collapsed  
into the black night --  

do not look at the moon, they told me  
so i kept my head down.
