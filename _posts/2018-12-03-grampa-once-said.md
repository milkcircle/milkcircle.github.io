grampa once said he could predict the rain  
his knees would ache and creak  
and he would know  
to bring an umbrella.

i never really believed  
that body parts could be a barometer  

until i met you.

my chest was my sensor  
and when i laid eyes upon your crescent smile  
i felt my chambered muscle flutter  

even in the dead of winter  
amidst the gray armageddon  
i knew  
in my world  
the sun would shine bright

what a shame that it can't be summer all year round

those butterflies took flight tonight  
and replaced their wings with crushing hurt  
the memory of that radiant glow  
sending sharp radiating spasms  
reverberating through this trunk

and i know  
that black sun dangling from the sky means nothing

eternal rains will come
