she wondered if  
the weight on her shoulders  
were stones heaved by God  
in retribution --  
she counted sins,  
measured virtues,  
searching for boulders  
to explain  
the burden  
of self-inflicted shame,  

but the mind, yours and mine  
and everyone's, is the devil,  
and the crushing weight of  
regret is ours and ours alone
