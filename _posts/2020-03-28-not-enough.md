for every one  
whose swelling love  
illuminates the night  

there is another  
who mourns the absence  
of all-encompassing  
comfort, ease, convenience,  
fame, gold,  

and looks the other way  
wondering where happiness lies  
with back turned  
toward the everlasting smiles  
pointed her way.
