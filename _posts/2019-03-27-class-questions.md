My class came up with some excellent questions today.  

1. Why can't you chelate iron from blood products before transfusing it?  
   What a fun question. Iron in blood products is not in the free form; it is bound up inside hemoglobin, which is essential for the blood to carry oxygen. Iron is released after the blood cell dies, and it's at this point that it can assume the free ionic form if not bound to transferrin.  

2. What happens to the iron after you chelate it?  
   It is excreted either through the urine or stool!  

3. What complications have you experienced from thalassemia?  
   Chelator-related issues: duodenal bleeding ulcer.  
   Transfusion-related issues: allergies (hives), transfusion-related acute lung injury.  

   These complications highlight the importance of continuing the search for better therapies. Blood transfusions also carry the risk of being contaminated with infectious agents (HIV, hepatitis, babesiosis)...and while extremely rare, the risk is additive and should be considered in patients who receive on the order of thousands of units of blood over the course of their lives. Additionally, iron chelators come with a set of toxicities (renal, hepatic) that many patients cannot tolerate.  

4. Can people develop antibodies to blood products to the extent that they can't get any more blood transfusions?  

   Yes! Though this is rare. Alloimmunization to blood products is a terrible thing to develop, and those rare unfortunate patients who have become immune to the blood they receive must then start on alternative therapies. I have only met a couple patients who are alloimmune, and they are the only ones I know who have had splenectomies and are on hydroxyurea as last-ditch attempts to improve their hemoglobin levels.  

   Interestingly, however, it seems the earlier a person starts on transfusion therapy the lower their risk may be to develop alloimmunity. This is not well-understood.  

5. Can you feel a difference before and after a transfusion?  

   The biggest difference is in endurance and cardiovascular exercise tolerance. I have carefully monitored my heart rate controlled for pace when I run, and there is a strong correlation to proximity of transfusion. I have not yet done a correlation between fatigue and pre-transfusion hemoglobin, but this analysis should be forthcoming.  

6. What excites you most about the future?  

   Gene therapy. I have heard this term thrown around in conferences and printed in brochures since I was a little kid, and I have always associated this technology with the idea of a cure for thalassemia. Unfortunately, there are many complications in the risk-benefit analysis for undergoing such a treatment; for instance, one of the steps in receiving an autologous stem cell transplant is busulfan chemotherapy, which has the potential for causing malignancies and infertility. Furthermore, it continues to be difficult to assess whether I would truly become transfusion independent...if not, I would have to consider whether the degree of reduction in transfusion burden is enough to make the therapy worth it.
