Sun, grayer than before, throwing tired jagged rays that melt in the cold. Dust, refracting frigid light in the air, pixelating the sky. Breezes whispering confidential messages to trees, which rustle with pleasure at the secrecy of the moment.  

Dusk. The suffocating blanket of black on orange. A collective deep breath. The huddled masses pull their scarves a little tighter, and draw the strings of their jackets closed.  

There is a settling of the atmosphere, and the wind carries with it tiny packets of desolate information. *If you open your eyes and engage your senses* -- my hair is windswept by the torrential secret -- *there will be an answer.*  

And as the autumn night descends, coating the Eastern seaboard with the shimmers of jewel-encrusted stars, the breezes die down a little bit, and a stillness rocks the Earth. *I learned it for you*, then quiet.
