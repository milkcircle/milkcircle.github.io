the bomb landed  
as i took a sip of tea,  
it was morning.  
you were wiping the  
sleep from your eyes,  
hair standing up on the right,  
your shirt's left shoulder  
slipped during the  
unconscious overnight battle  
for the sheets,  
the wind whistling through  
the window draft,  
a flicker of light  
coinciding with the muffle  
of napalm slamming into the world.  
there was a silence, calm.  
everything ended, and  
immortalized in shadow were the imprints  
of you wiping sleep from your eyes,  
me sipping tea,  
and the smallest hint of a smile  
between us, like a hey  
quickly turned into a bye,  
thanks for everything.
