whose voice do you hear when you're most afraid?  
what acts do you see in your mind's charade?  
why are you scared of the meds you take?  
which of your doctors do you think are fake?  
after this stay, where will you go?  
will your family take you when you show?  
do you know that on this floor  
you're known as the psychotic woman in bed 4?
