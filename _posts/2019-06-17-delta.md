here's a secret for you  
nobody else knows:  

all of life forms a torus  
and all of you  
and all of me  
will one day come full circle.  

we'll tumble and turn  
and diverge and converge  
until we collide at the end of the cycle.

all of life is a farce  
we'll exit and enter  
and we'll laugh and we'll cry  
until we find each other at intermission.  

and here's the crux of it all, my dear:  
all of life comes to a point  
and when you find your delta one day  
i'll be there cheering for you.
