between you and me  
there is worried silence,  
eerie like the soft  
breaths when we run out of things to say  
but can't bring ourselves to hang up,  

tense like the  
concerned furrowed brows  
when we think of the future  

yet calm, ever calm  
like gentle laps of waves,  
purrs of contentment,  
rises and falls of sleeping chests,  

and warmth of home  
blanketed in snow,  
fireplace crackling,  
whispered gossip,  

careful clinks of sherry wine  
and blush of rosy cheeks  
when we live the present  
(and only the present)  
and endeavor to let the cards fall where they may.
