when  
all about you is the dark, and  
tired limbs fasciculate with anxious thoughts,  

when  
all around you is the pressure  
of a thousand deeds and others' needs...  

and walls close in and  
you find yourself  
burdened by expectation,  

won't you remember this?  

that i too am human, and you and i will,  
in the company of each other's  
brutal thoughts and worried breaths,  
hold each other (to better standards),  

and we'll tell each other  
that we'll try again tomorrow.
