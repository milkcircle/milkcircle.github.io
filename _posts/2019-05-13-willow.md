to sit beneath the hunchback-weeping willow  
and blanket myself with its showering sorrowed tears,  
to sit beside a burgeoning swelling tulip  
and hear its gentle lovesongs in my ears  

to bask in the glow of a towering sunflower  
and tan myself under its radiant heat  
or to stare inside the souls of pollen'd irises  
as if to face my heart's own wicked beat  

to live in gardens bursting of sunshine florets  
and bask beneath the sweet and sundown'd shade  
is not enough; for no matter how big the garden  
all of it for you, i'd surely trade
