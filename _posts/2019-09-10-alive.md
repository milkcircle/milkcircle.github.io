as we hug  
and laugh  
and clink our wineglasses  
and smile  
and whisper our deepest desires  

i wonder  

this love we share  
what is it?  

will it take the shape  
of the vessel we put it in?  

or, like the balloon in the  
grubby hands of a birthday boy   

will it fly away the moment  
we stop paying attention?  

i keep looking around me  
to see if others can feel what i feel.  

there is a warmth that chills me  
and makes me shiver  
like frisson under a heavy blanket  
by a crackling soft fireplace.  

the pebbles by my feet are hypervibrant  
as though someone has endowed me  
with color vision for the first time.  

there is crispness in the autumn air.  

i think back to that class  
where the teacher asked us:  
"how do we define life?  

how do we tell  
when something is alive?"  

and i raised my hand and said, "when you can kill it."  

i stay still as a statue,  
afraid that if i move  
or blink  
i'll lose this moment  

and i can't help but ask myself,  

if what we have between us feels so, so alive  
then which one of us will eventually kill it?
