if the mind is a battlefield  
then mine is a goddamn war zone  

shrapnel showers from the shattered sky  
blistering bombshells blow apart the already broken  
and, nearby, cripples lament the souls departed  

heavens painted red with the aerosolized blood of friend and foe  
fires spew clouds of cremated ashes  
until they, dense with the dead, send acid rain down upon the survivors  

planes promising packages of sweet relief  
shot down upon the beach sands wet with regret  

O' God! i beg you please!  
deliver me the blissful quiet!

will you end it, or will I?
