you are mine  
you were mine  
you are fine  
you’re divine  
we could lie  
intertwined  
and i drink  
you like wine  


i am high  
you and i  
we could lie  
here all night  
i am drunk  
i could die  
staring in-  
to your eyes  

all the things  
we could be  
if you’d just  
chosen me  
we could flee  
and be free  
and sip tea  
by the sea  

and although  
i have fall-  
en for you  
and your glow  
i just know  
you’ll say no  
so i think  
i should go
