go for long enough,  
and the whens and ifs run out  
and buts and not-yets  
and the conditionals never work  
and the criteria never fill  

and what's left  
is unbreached opportunity,  
the death of options,  
the heat-exhaustion of  
a patiently dying man,  

who leaves for something better  
than to try to convince  
the poor soul who can't leave the desert.
