go for long enough,  
and the whens and ifs  
and buts and not-yets  
will all run out  
and the conditionals will never work  
and the criteria will never fill  

and what's left  
will be unbreached opportunity,  
the death of options,  
the heat-exhaustion of  
a patiently dying man,  

who will leave for something better  
than to try to convince  
the poor soul who won't leave the desert.
