"i am fire and deceit," she whispered,  
hands in mine, turbulent winds around us,  
her sundress whipping in the hot smoke,  
tears stinging my eyes. i knew what she was.  
when her youth blossomed into adolescence, and  
potential into reality, she turned to the wilderness,  
and left us in the ash.
