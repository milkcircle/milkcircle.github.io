come here, saccharine  
hand me your keys,  
hand me your keys  
so i can drive you insane  

come here, sweet you  
lend me your ears,  
lend me your ears  
so i can whisper your name  

turn around, my delight  
bring me your brush  
bring me your brush  
so i can paint away my blues  

join me, young fancy  
and give me your hands  
give me your hands  
so i can trace iloveyous
