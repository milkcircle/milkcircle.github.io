i ask the  
weary doctor, with  
dark circles under her worn eyes:  

dearest doctor, your skin  
has suffered with the passage of time  
and your eyes have borne witness  
to a hundred deaths.  

you do not sleep  
and if you do  
you close your eyes only to open  
your mind to nightmares of  
souls departed.  

why do you keep going on?  

said she:  

i keep my eyes open  
so that others may close theirs  
whether in comfort of my presence  
or in finality of life.  

i watch horrible things happen  
because i can  
and others cannot  
and i will spare them from seeing what must be seen by me.  

she smiles a weary smile,  
a smile of all smiles;  
for as you know, my dear:  
a smile can either be  
genuine, or a facade to mask a darker underbelly truth...  
hers was genuine, a radiant beam in a life of death.  

she stands up, waves, and departs  
and in her shadow, her thousand children rejoice.
