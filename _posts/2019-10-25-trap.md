they say raccoon traps work  
because raccoons adamantly refuse  
to let go of the bait  

and they will die rather than undo  
their tiny fists.  

stupid animals -- i thought --  
to see something shiny  
and refuse to let go  
even in the face of death  

...i thought i was above that  
until you came along,  
glittering in gold  

and i could feel the world spinning  
faster and faster, and the  
centrifugal forces pushing me off  
the surface of the earth  

the planet became a dizzying top  
and it was all i could do  
to hold onto something solid  
with all my strength  
so i wouldn't be flung from the world with you in it  

until i realized  
you -- and the world you inhabit --  
are a paw trap, and i  
knowing full well what is to come  
will not let go.
