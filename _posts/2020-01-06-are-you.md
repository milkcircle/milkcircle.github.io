i need a drink,  
and i need to sit  
and think a little...  

watch the world shrink  
in front of me, feel my  
heart sink within this  
cold dying cavity,  

grasped and pulled by  
the fingers of gravity  

witness the world's  
unveiled depravity.  

i need to lie down.  

sit on the edge  
before i fall in and drown,  

my thoughts keep on bouncing around,  
i cannot hear myself think,  

i need to lie down.  

i need to think.  

i need some quiet,  
and you tell me to breathe,  
you tell me to try it,  
try not to fight it,  
but all i can do is  
to ask for some quiet  
as i lie on the ground  
and struggle to think.  

what's it all for?  
what more  
can there be,  
if there's no  
you and me  
what war  
am i fighting  
if not for  
you and me?  

and i lie on the ground  
and i breathe and i think  

and the starling beside me  
stops and sighs --  

let it be  
let it be  
let it be
