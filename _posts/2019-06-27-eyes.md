if my eyes dart from east to west  
in nervous twitching saccades  
like mice in the humdrum dark  
skirting from hiding-spot to hiding-spot  

if my mouth stammers in pressured speech  
as though each consonant hurts to let go  
like a stray hungry dog unsure  
whether to approach the friendly hand  
or to run away  

(for the past has not been kind to him  
and the present has no gift to bear  
and the starving hound's loyal snout reveals  
the scars of a violent youth)  

if i may seem timid, desolate, and abandoned  
(and my bloodshot eyes reflect  
a homeless canine's whimpers  
and a rodent's broken whiskers)  

forgive me  
for it is only because i am.
