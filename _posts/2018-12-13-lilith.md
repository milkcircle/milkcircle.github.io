You! Lilith, fallen angel  
Leech of men and Queen of Lies  
Screech not your siren-song,  
Take off your disguise!  

Bless'd with beauty, lyric voice  
But marred with demon heart  
Fool them all with your facade  
And tear the world apart  

Seed your darkness in the pure  
Drag them down to hell  
Distend yourself on their abundance  
Bid your soul farewell

How many men must suffer from  
Your avarice and greed?  
How much more destruction  
Till you satisfy your needs?
