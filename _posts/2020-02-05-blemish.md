would you love with me  
the unloved things:  
critters, undergrowths,  
burls, crevices  
where dark things hide?  

would you smile with me  
at those who've never seen a smile,  
and shine your grace at those  
who've never felt the light of day?  

run with me into the rain  
fall with me into the mud?  

crouch with me to feed the poor,  
blanket the cold, heal the sick?  

and when  
we both grow  
stiff and old  

will you amble with me  
and crease your eyes in joy  
at the imperfections you  
and i  
are blessed with?
