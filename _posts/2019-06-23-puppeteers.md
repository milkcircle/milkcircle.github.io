an angel and devil  
sit atop my shoulders  
legs dangling onto my chest.  

one puppetmaster tugs at my heartstrings  
and whispers  
"this is it.  
this is it.  
italy beckons  
and fate awaits."  

the other, not to be outdone  
snarls in my ear  
"let it go.  
let it go.  
it is not your time."  

and i -- confused marionette --  
collapse under a tumultuous burden  
and wonder which limbs to move  
and which to keep still  

for the two puppeteers are identical twins  
and i cannot for the life of me  
tell who's who.
