these sinews screaming silence, burning hot  
excruciating quiet, lost in thought  
these tendons slowly breaking, under weight  
subdued emotions absent, as of late...  

to summit yonder cliff, lonesome free  
to call my loving tendrils back to me  
to witness life and life again  
and submit to Father Time, only then...  

to humbly win, nor show these winnings  
and start again, with new beginnings  
to burst and smolder, clothed in ashen flame  
yet never bury my own head in shame...  

may these choking lungs wash ashore  
and may this phoenix heart yet live once more  
since from this local peak i can see  
ranges upon ranges around me
