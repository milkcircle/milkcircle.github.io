*a loving good heart is riches enough, and without it intellect is poverty.*  
-- Mark Twain

two doves fell silently from the cover of clouds tonight,  
intertwined in each other's soft wings,  
and landed on concrete like cushioned hail.  

i watched as the white feathers reddened with avian blood,  

and quickly moved on  
for the clouds were darkening ominously  
as if threatening to deliver more birds.  

a wind was picking up, throwing sand into my eyes and dust around my  
aching feet,  

and the sky launched morose teardrops to the thirsty earthen pastures.  

i went home to you, unsure whether my sadness was a reaction to the fallen fledglings  
or whether it was coming from within.  

your eyes were empty of their familiar flames,  
and mine brimmed with salt

as i approached you for one last embrace  
before we too would drop out of our heaven  
and quietly plummet to the vast depths below.
