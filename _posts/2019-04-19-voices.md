they tell me to take my clozaril.  
it'll make the voices go away, they say.  

i tell them no, no, no.  
i tell them no.  
i scream at them no. i fight them no.  
i squirm and bite them.  

no.  

for the only reason i live  
is to hear your voice inside my head  
and i shall fight them till the end  
restraints and all  
before i let them take you from me again.
