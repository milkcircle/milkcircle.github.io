and there amidst the greatest uncertainty of all  
devoid of light, a suffocating black blanket of nothingness  
in the ceaseless horizon of darkness above us  
with nothing, not even a string of hope to tug us back to reality  

there, in the invisible mists of dark matter and antigravity  
we float, our screams sucked into the muffled vacuum of spacetime.  

we hang in the heart of shadows and pretend we see light  
until we realize that the swirls of past and future are only mind tricks  
hallucinations  
hypnagogic movies  

we hover, pointing at the moonlight sonata,  
the strings of our hearts plucked like a broken harp  
our minds beaten like piano hammers churning out minor chords  
biding our time until we -- yes, we, you and I -- can  
finally turn this ship around and find our light again.  

and so we'll drift in this pitch black sea  
our disembodied souls searching for what they once had  
swimming softly toward each other  
until waves wash us ashore  
or drown us both.
