Four years ago when the ground rumbled and shook\\
I watched the sidewalk blister and crack\\
As a ladder emerged from the depths of the Earth

I touched its sleek, clean ivory rungs\\
And strained my neck to see where it led\\
But there was no end in sight

So I stepped onto the ladder and climbed\\
And with each rung\\
The world grew smaller beneath me

I climbed until I could no longer see my parents’ faces\\
Until the city became a grid\\
Until the people and cars were like specks of slow-moving dust

And past the familiar grid\\
I could see other fields of specks, some brighter the others\\
I climbed until these plains merged into one

When I finally tired I looked up\\
And saw more ladder above me, as though I had never started\\
The ivory beckoned as though there were a prize at the elusive end

Four years I climbed, and from the lonely rungs in the sky\\
I saw alien places from afar\\
Colors and textures I never knew existed

And it took four years for me to realize\\
The ladder would never end\\
I stopped my ascent, and looked down

Remembering a time when I was one of the specks within a speck\\
How firm the ground was\\
How before the ladder appeared I had never yearned to climb…

Then I began my slow descent.
