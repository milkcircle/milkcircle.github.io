<p class="intro">Four years ago when the ground rumbled and shook</p>
I watched the sidewalk blister and crack<br>
As a ladder emerged from the depths of the Earth

I touched its sleek, clean ivory rungs<br>
And strained my neck to see where it led<br>
But there was no end in sight

So I stepped onto the ladder and climbed<br>
And with each rung<br>
The world grew smaller beneath me

I climbed until I could no longer see my parents’ faces<br>
Until the city became a grid<br>
Until the people and cars were like specks of slow-moving dust

And past the familiar grid<br>
I could see other fields of specks, some brighter the others<br>
I climbed until these plains merged into one

When I finally tired I looked up<br>
And saw more ladder above me, as though I had never started<br>
The ivory beckoned as if there were a prize at the elusive end

Four years I climbed, and from the lonely rungs in the sky<br>
I saw alien places from afar<br>
Colors and textures I never knew existed

And it took four years for me to realize<br>
The ladder would never end<br>
I stopped my ascent, and looked down

Remembering a time when I was but a speck within a speck<br>
How firm the ground was<br>
How before the ladder appeared I had never yearned to climb…

Then I began my slow descent.
