## The Ladder

Four years ago the ladder appeared
It burst through the grass in my front yard
As though it came from Earth's core

Sleek ivory rungs that gleamed in the daylight
Though I strained my neck to see where it led
There was no end in sight

So I stepped onto the ladder and climbed
And with each rung 
The world grew smaller beneath me

Until I could no longer see my parents' faces
And the city became a grid
And the people and cars, like specks of slow-moving dust

Up ahead past the familiar grid
Were other fields of specks, some less organized than others
And I kept climbing until the plains merged into one

I was at a dizzying height
But there was more ladder above me
Each rung beckoning as though there were a prize at the elusive end

Four more years I climbed, and I saw
So many other places from afar
Colors and textures I never knew existed

And it took four years for me to realize that
The ladder would never end
I stopped my ascent, sighed, and looked down

Remembering the time when I was one of the specks within a speck
How firm the ground was
How, before there was a ladder, I had never yearned to climb...

Then I began my slow descent.
