like moses, your corrupt hands  
build brutal bridges  
with the silverback nickles and dimes  
of those who enter your empire  

and with the death of your pedestal  
comes my own silurian extinction  
a whole half of me, in a blinding fury of excruciating pain,  
torn cleanly from my heart and mind  

and though the ordovician burns like hell on earth  
fires sweeping through forests of ferns now caught in the net of demise  
neither of us can deny that  
your devonian devilry didn't birth the adaptive radiation  

that brought her to me now
