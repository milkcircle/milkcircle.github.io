i hear your thoughts(i hear them soft  
i whisper them to my inner ears)i know  
your wants(whatever you want i want  
to give,my dear)i hear your fears(whatever  
you fear i want to quell,my sweet)  
i learn your whimsies(whatever you do  
i want to welcome,my heart)  

and you're the river between my dried-up banks  
(what keeps my soils green and my chambers full)  
and the sun's splendor is nothing more  
than a shadow to your smile(it's the glow  
you use to warm my soul)  

what a wonderful miracle that the history of  
Everything  
coalesced over the course of  
Forever  

to form nothing more than  
You,which holds my soul together  
with nothing less than  
your thoughts(i hear them soft  
i whisper them to my inner ears)
