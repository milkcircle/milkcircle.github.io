i've been thinking about space lately.  

about how i wandered astray amongst the stars  
until i found the perfect constellations that dotted your skin.  

and how your eyes like Sirius  
labeled the pitch-black sky  
like a Sun whose cosmic rays  
shine a beacon of hope in the neverending darkness  

i followed your dippers  
and found your orion's belt  

you smuggled me away  
from Aries' godless wars  
and we hitched a ride upon  
Auriga's chariots  

you, my Capricorn  
and i, your Canis  

adventured the moonlit starry skies  
making the heavens our playground.  

they warned us that the universe wouldn't stop expanding,  
but i didn't listen.  

until the day i woke up and found the distance between us  
had exploded  

and my shouts for you shrank into silence in the midnight abyss  

and when you didn't respond  
i made it my mission  
to navigate the forests of celestial stars  
to find my Aphrodite again.
