who would have guessed that romance is haploinsufficient?  
or that lunar honey runs out like a damned pyramid?  

despite even our efforts most valient...  
we both knew even we couldn't outrun impending entropy  
and that one night you'd stab me with those staggered silver tines  

and i'd be left in the dust with the dying daylilies
