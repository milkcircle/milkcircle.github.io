white wine  
pasta with pepper grounds and parmesan snowflakes  
freshly made bed  
and barely visible snow through a spiderwebbed window  
we're in my room.  

clinks of the glasses and whispered giggles  
with affectionate words at the tips of our tongues  
we stare at the stormy skies behind the heated safety of the wall,  
warmed by the wine flushing our faces  
by the cotton-wool comforter  
and by each other  

and i stare at that outline across your neck  
tracing its fragile butterfly silhouette  

and silently in the dark of the room  
we dance, unchoreographed, to silent music  
in an impromptu rhythm we inexplicably recognize  

until even the moonlight is extinguished.
