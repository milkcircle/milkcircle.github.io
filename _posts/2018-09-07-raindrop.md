what does a raindrop see  
when it's being hurled to the surface of the earth at twenty miles an hour?  

because i'm falling down  
from the thirtieth story  
and honestly, it's all a blur

how does a raindrop keep its composure  
when it's due to hit concrete in seconds?

how does it keep from screaming like i'm doing --  
or, at least trying to --  
i can't make much sound when the air is stuffing my lungs.

does the droplet's life flash before its eyes?  
does it remember its adiabatic birth?  
could it recognize its origin tempest?

maybe it doesn't have to  
because it knows the impact won't be its end  
for isn't all rain recycled?

i wonder if i'll be reborn  
maybe the next incarnation won't jump --
