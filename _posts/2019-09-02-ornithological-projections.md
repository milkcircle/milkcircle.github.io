the bluejay  
carries no blue pigment  
on its flapping passerine feathers;  

its color  
is formed by the observer's mind  
imprinted upon its chirping body.  

and: should the bluejay's feather  
be crushed and examined closely  
you would find it devoid of its  
brilliant azure shine.  

the bluejay reminds me of you:  
a dazzlingly ornate being  
which, once examined closely  
breaks down into empty substance  
and the realization that all the beauty  
was fabricated by my own mind.
