I sip you like a glass of wine  
A sparkling riesling white  
And feel those jitters settle with  
The dry acidic bite

I smoke you like a cigarette  
Your vapors ebb and flow  
My head encased in scented mist  
The cigarette aglow  

And with you as my gateway  
You enchant me with your spell  
These hits of dopamine become  
My only living hell

Until one day I find myself  
Awakened from my trance  
And finally decide to give  
My life another chance

You've been replaced! My poison pill  
My once-essential drug  
I'm moving onto better things  
Accept my parting hug  

I'll leave it up to Piet Hein  
Whose words I think are best  
"Err and err and err again  
But less and less and less."
