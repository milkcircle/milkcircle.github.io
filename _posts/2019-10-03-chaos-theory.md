the growing gusts  
of chilling winds  
carry in their arms  
the scent of ennui  

portending curtains  
of alabaster sleet  

and i am left  
in a swarm of flapping  
butterflies  

recalling the dynamical systems  
in which  

hurricanes are caused  
by little bursts  
of glowing air  
spun out of stillness  
by your colorful arthropod wings.
