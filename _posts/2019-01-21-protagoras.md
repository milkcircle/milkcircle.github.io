an infant is, as they say,  
born solipsistic.  

and only with additional evidence to the contrary  
do they adopt an appropriate theory of mind,  
the saving grace from schizoid tendencies,  
sociopathy, addiction,  
and sets them on the righteous path of empathy.  

but what then, of the sliver of humans  
who for some reason are never emancipated by  
this neo-piagetian philosophy?  

perhaps they fall prey to akratic hells  
the habits of hyperbolic discounting  

are these people truly demons of their own doing?  
or are they victims  
fallen to the hands of time  
moving forth in a frenzy of short-term passions  
only to find themselves -- decades later --  
looking back in search of  
the good things that got away?
