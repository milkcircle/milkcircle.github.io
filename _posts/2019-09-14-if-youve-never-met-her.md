if you've never met her  
you might not know  
that though she's broken  
and knows no other way  
than to break others too  
she has a presence  
that makes you forget  
you're just as broken...  
because in her eyes  
there's a fire that dances  
and a light that sings to you  
and you'll drink that brightness  
which illuminates the darkest shadows  
standing before a woman  
who looks like she's broken
