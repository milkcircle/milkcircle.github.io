south into the commons  
and there's the faint skunky smell of weed  
and the flowers are bursting like  
a proofing sourdough and  
girls chasing their puppies  
which are chasing squirrels  
which are running up trees and  
it's enough to overlook for just a minute  
that you can't make out anyone's faces  
since they're all covered up  
but for a short while it's alright  
because even from behind the fabric  
you can see the smile in the eyes  
of the children and the  
wagging tails of dogs and  
the flowers are telling you  
there's still color in the world.
