Help!  
I am lost I am lost in the wind  
Crouched in thine arms I admit I have sinned  
I look upon thee shamefully  
Mine virtue I have slain for thee  

Weep!  
I am cursed I am cursed into hell  
Miracles lost I am cast like a spell  
Medusa thou hast ruined me  
Granite heart thou'st given me 

Stop!  
I am dead I am dead in the lake  
The sun and the moon cannot force me awake  
O Lord prepare thine Hadean gates  
Mine tortured soul for thee awaits  

Blessed are the righteous few  
With senses sharp, and ethics true  

May the humble spited free  
Sing their voices heavenly
