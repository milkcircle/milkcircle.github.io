i hope you think of me sometimes  
in between bites of breakfast bagels  
(who would've guessed vegan could be so good?)  

i hope you think of me sometimes  
when on a quiet dim-lit street  
a young girl tugs at her distant father...  
"hey! whatcha doin?"  

i hope you think of me sometimes  
when the breezes bring your soft hair  
across your lovely face  
and a hand (whosever it is) appears  
to gently brush each strand away  

i hope you think of me sometimes,  
as i think of you  
with the sky's sighing breaths  
and the sun's heavy flames  
that kindle an ocean of memories  
within my aching mind.
