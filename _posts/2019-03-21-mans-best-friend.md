i held your head in my hand  
and though your cataracts dimmed your glow  
your love still shone through.  

i hugged you, and patted your head.  
you were too tired to stand up.

"see you soon, little buddy."  
and luggage in hand i walked away  

knowing in my heart of hearts  
the next time i'd see you  

would be in the hereafter  
when your broken body and mine  
would be repaired, reunited,  
and free to run the lengths of all the parks in heaven.
