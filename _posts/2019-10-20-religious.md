the closest thing to  
a religious moment  
i've experienced  

is the second of silence  
after the night team  
quietly announces  
in between bleary-eyed sips  
of lukewarm coffee:  

"Ms. Smith in 113 passed."  

and the deafening hush that befalls  
the tiny huddle of  
decade-old computers  

silences even the  
nervous beeps of IV poles  
rings of distant phones  
squeaky wheels of hospital beds in transit  

and the quiet is only broken by  
the sudden squawk of a pager:  
"man in 107 is complaining of pain,  
ok to give dilaudid?"  

and even a godless man can't help but  
look up for a split second --  
in remembrance of the lady  
with the newly diagnosed cancer  
who just last week was on a family vacation  
and collapsed from a seizure --   

before taking another sip of bitter caffeine,  
swiveling around in the plastic chair  
and getting back to work.
