Four years ago, the ground rumbled and shook  
and I watched the sidewalk blister and crack  
as a ladder emerged from the depths of the Earth

I touched its sleek, clean ivory rungs  
and strained my neck to see where it led  
but there was no end in sight

So I stepped onto the ladder and climbed  
and with each rung  
the world grew smaller beneath me

I climbed until I could no longer see my parents’ faces  
until the city became a grid  
until the people and cars were like specks of slow-moving dust

And past the familiar grid  
I could see other fields of specks, some brighter than the others  
I climbed until these plains merged into one

When I finally tired I looked up  
and saw more ladder above me, as though I had never started  
the ivory beckoning as if there were a prize at the elusive end

Four years I climbed, and from the lonely rungs in the sky  
I saw alien places from afar  
colors and textures I never knew existed

And it took four years for me to realize  
the ladder would never end  
I stopped my ascent, and looked down

Remembering a time when I was but a speck within a speck  
how firm the ground was  
how before the ladder appeared I had never yearned to climb…

Then I began my slow descent.
