title: Cantor's Diagonal Argument

Below I describe an elegant proof first presented by the brilliant Georg Cantor. Through this argument Cantor determined that the set of all real numbers (\mathbb{R}) is uncountably — rather than countably — infinite. The proof demonstrates a powerful technique called “diagonalization” that heavily influenced the field of metamathematics; indeed, Gödel’s incompleteness theorems employ a similar technique to prove that no set of mathematical axioms can be both complete and consistent, thereby establishing one of the most important limitations in mathematics.

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
