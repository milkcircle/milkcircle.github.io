that our hearts once beat in synchrony  
and that our lives are soaked in irony  
that i know your favorite wine  
and that you too know which is mine  

that i still can feel your gentle touch  
and that i can miss it so, so much  
that you can hear my voice through words  
and that yours still sounds like songs of birds  

that i still sing your favorite song  
in hopes one day you'll sing along  
that when i whisper i love you  
i imagine that you say it too
