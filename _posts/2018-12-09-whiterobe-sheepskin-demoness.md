whiterobe sheepskin demoness  
knelt before the masses  
horns beneath the propped-up halo  
full lips masking venom

worshipped by the innocent  
praying doth the prey  
fed and fattened by the poor  
feasts upon the flush

village torn to ruins and rubble  
nary a finger lifted  
bloodshed pure, within the tribal  
battles 'midst the pastures  

O Siddhartha counterfeit  
thy mesmerizing lies  
hath torn apart thy 'mirers  
those bridges set aflame  

and when those meadows empty  
and the destitute expire  
who will feed the devil then  
the hamlet all but squandered?
