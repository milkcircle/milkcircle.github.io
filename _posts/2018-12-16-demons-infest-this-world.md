you used to tell me  
you thought you were a bad person.  

i used to look into your eyes and reply  
i see a person  
who makes good and bad decisions  
just like everybody else.  

i used to believe it, too.  

you would point out all your flaws  
and i would tell you  
that if you knew your flaws  
and could change them too  
and *improve* yourself  
then nothing in your actions  
could be unforgivable.  

i used to believe it, too.  

for what is more human  
than to make mistakes,  
and what could be better  
than to learn from them?  

then one night you took out your pistol  
the same one you used to kill all the others before me  
and you cleaned it  
and pointed it at me  

and as the gunpowder lit  
and the shot rang  
and the bullet traversed the room  
and the slug tore through my skin  
and my rib crunched from the impulse  
and my blood spilled onto the linoleum  

as i fell backward  
and glimpsed at your remorseless face  
and saw your grin glinting in the light  
and watched as you removed your mask  
to reveal the repulsive, grotesque, vile form beneath  

as i lay upon that hard, wet floor  
struggling to breathe  
watching your silhouette slither to the house next door  
to prepare your next murder  

i realized  
demons infest this world  
and you're one of them.
