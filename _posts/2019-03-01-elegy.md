amidst this worn-out, tired throng  
immersed in weeping rain  
appears a triumph-raptured song  
a respite from our pain  

above, a wearied sparrow cries  
below: a sham d√©tente  
and there among those dreary sighs  
we take our merry jaunt  

within this battered crumbling hall  
we build our mellow home  
as our facade begins to fall
i form my doting poem  

for you i write these joyous words  
to drown a world gray  
i sing these withered broken chords  
to soar above the fray  

and even as our story ends  
the echoes of this song  
recall the bygone love and friends,  
a home where we'd belong
