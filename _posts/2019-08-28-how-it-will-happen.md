butterflies were not made to fly long distances  
but you did.  

you spread your dewdrop wings  
chased a soul and back  
meekly stepped foot  
into a tiger's quarter  

danced a choreic dance  
celebrated your survival  
celebrated others' survival  

and before long your shifted  
circadian hummed like a cicada  
a hummingbird's musical  
a familiar tune  
and returned on the back of a bird.  

what will happen then?  

there is no butterfly net   
nor nectar dish  
nor rosepollen  

but there is this place  
i call a home away from home  
a place you've been before  

where open arms will welcome you  
from your cramped and tired flight  
forgetting the priors and only  
focusing on what's left to come.  

and before the stone arms crumble for good  
they stay open in hopes that they can offer  
comfort to the weary wings, a final time.
