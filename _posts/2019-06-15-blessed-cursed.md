blessed are the gods of rain  
whose teardrops wash away the pain  
of abel's death at the hands of cain  
of the nymph who betrayed her loyal swain  

cursed are the devilled few  
whose hearts reflect an onyx hue  
whose derelict rejection of the genuine and true  
will one day be the death of you
