A patient comes in with weight loss and a fine tremor. A TSH is drawn and found to be undetectable. What are the appropriate next steps?  

An inappropriately low TSH with symptoms of hyperthyroidism is suggestive of primary hyperthyroidism (a derangement with the thyroid) as opposed to secondary/central hyperthyroidism (a derangement with the pituitary or hypothalamus). It would be reasonable to repeat a TSH with reflex (which will include a total T3 and free T4 when TSH is abnormal) as well as a TSI and TBII (which are sensitive for Graves disease, the most common underlying cause of primary hyperthyroidism). The physical exam that is pathognomonic for Graves is a thyroid bruit (this should be done *before* palpation of the thyroid, as palpation will increase blood flow). If there is a palpable abnormality, an ultrasound with doppler is indicated.  

The proper imaging workup should include a radioactive iodine uptake scan. Patients who are pregnant should not receive this test and should instead elect for either labs or ultrasound to evaluate the hyperthyroidism instead. History should include medication history and supplementation, as a common cause of this disease is surreptitious use of levothyroxine.  

Treatment of Graves favors methimazole (over PTU, which is associated with a higher risk of hepatic necrosis) -- the most worrying side effect is agranulocytosis in rare cases. Radioactive iodine can also be used, though should not be used in patients with Graves ophthalmopathy. In severe refractory cases, complete thyroidectomy and subsequent levothyroxine therapy can be done. Prior to completion of workup, hyperthyroid symptoms can be mitigated with beta blockers (such as once-daily atenolol). In many cases, methimazole can be weaned as the patient enters remission, but may need to be restarted afterward.
