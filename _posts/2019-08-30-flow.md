our flow is an inviscid one.  

we pulse through bernoulli paths,  
turbulent waves releasing our potential energy  
in a fiery crash at the shore  

and where the high tide meets the sand  
the ocean draws each dying wave back  
revealing the remnants of castles destroyed by the tumult  

yet, amidst the lachrymose chaos  
there is rebirth and there is revival  
for the waves are gearing up to shower us once again  

in torrential harmony.
