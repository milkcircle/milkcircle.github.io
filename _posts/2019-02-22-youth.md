adolescence is  

stepping a timid foot into pitch black  
eyes hungering for light  
pupils growing and growing  
while your ears twitch  

uncovering a world of heavy breathing  
creaks and footsteps  
shouts and laughter  
clinks and shatters  

and you feel a hand grasp yours  
tugging you gently as you fall upon a soft linened silhouette  

all the while being invaded by new sounds  
guiding you slowly away from the door  
until you hear the quiet laps of waves at your feet.  

and a ferric stench rises to meet you  
as you realize  
the sounds were nothing more  
than your id slaughtering and discarding your superego.
