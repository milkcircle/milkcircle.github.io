i'll take you  
down to the burning bridges  
to show you how our islands parted  

i'll take you  
up to the snowy hilltops  
to show you all the cold i feel  

i'll take you  
with me to the morgue  
so you may see my dead inside  

i'll take you  
to the sunset shores  
to witness sunlight's last goodbye  

i'll take you  
on a trip to Nowhere  
to bury you inside my mind  

i'll take you  
in a ship to Space  
so you can see the world i left  

and when i've  
finished taking you places  
i'll bring you home to rest at last  

and ask you  
once we're warm and cozy  
where you'd like to take me next
