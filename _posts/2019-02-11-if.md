if perchance you one day choose  
to speak to me again  

i'd more than happily oblige  
to listen to you then  

for there's nothing that would please me more  
than chat with friends of old  

to warm the bonds between us  
which have come to be so cold  

but i would ask you one small favor  
i know you'll understand  

hold your words inside your mouth  
before you let them land  

roll them 'round and taste them  
let them sit and steep an hour  

make sure those words are not another  
sugar-coated sour  

and in that pensive measure  
take a look at all your verbs  

are they present tense or past?  
will they keep my thoughts disturbed?  

are your words all true or are they but  
deceptively adorned?  

are all those tepid sorry's  
dripping apathy and scorn?  

hold your thoughts until you're sure  
that they should all be spoken  

and, absent that conclusion  
keep your tulips tight unbroken  

for i've no need for requiems  
your pity or your lies  

or honeyed words aplenty  
that are daggers in disguise..  

and if perchance you one day find  
your words all past the tests  

let them freely fly to me  
i'll treat them all as guests;  

let the burden off your chest  
may fate decide the rest
