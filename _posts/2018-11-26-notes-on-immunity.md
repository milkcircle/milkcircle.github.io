*Notes in progress*

Innate immunity
===
* Physical and chemical barriers
* Phagocytic cells
	- Neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, natural killer cells, innate lymphoid cells
* Blood proteins
	- Complements and other mediators of inflammation

Adaptive immunity
===
* Major players are B and T cells
* Two major categories include *humoral* and *cell-mediated* immunity
	- Humoral immunity is mediated by antibodies and targets microbes outside of cells.
	- Cell-mediated immunity targets intracellular microbes, such as viruses.
		- Helper T cells activate macrophages and neutrophils to kill phagocytosed microbes.
		- Cytotoxic T cells directly kill infected cells.
