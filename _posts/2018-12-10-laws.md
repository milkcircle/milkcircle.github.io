time! unseen invariant  
the clock before which all is judged  

time will blur the lesser details,  
sharpen only senses true  

light! that beam will travel fast  
with no regard to reference  

light will yield the path to peace  
whether with or without you

gravity! that consequence  
of masses spawning curvature

gravity shall keep me grounded  
clear in mind of right and wrong

magnetism! in a moment  
weakens as our distance grows

magnetism! it shall pull us  
into place where we belong
