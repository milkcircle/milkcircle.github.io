there's a step near the end  
where you're supposed to take a razorblade  
and score the dough before the final bake  

or else the rise will break  
through the dough's weakest point  
and spill out the side  

and as i cleaned up the mess in the oven  
i wondered if there was some analogy there  

it can't have been that you slowly filled me  
with tempered rage, masked as tolerance and  
accommodation, or that  

past the tipping point of  
heat in the moment and red flames,  
the image of my skull exploding  

for someone else to clean up  
flashed for an instant in the  
back of my mind.
