next door, a woman starves of affection,  
and feeds herself excuses.  

she fills with the bloodied remnants  
of soldiers past,  
engorging upon a ferric feast.

through thin walls  
i listen to the pitterpatter of the wailing gods  
whose teardrops wash away the stains  
and leave a soft heavenly petrichor  

and with it  
the wintered frost dissolves into spring showers.
