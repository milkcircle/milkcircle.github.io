she was preblizzard  
sleet turned to ice,  
premature solstice  

she was polychrome indecision  
moth trapped in silk  
half buried in patchwork loam  

she was the overtone  
dissonance realized  
hiding beneath decaying song  

she was a melting ice dagger  
shadow noose strangling  
love worth half a lifespan
