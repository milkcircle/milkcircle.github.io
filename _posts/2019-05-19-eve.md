adam and eve  
climbing trees  
i hear their joyous shouts through the leaves.  

a crunch and snap,  
and eve falls,  
her rib breaks.  

i ask young adam,  
"did you shove her?"  
and he wistfully says "no"  
before disappearing again into the branches.  

a serpent emerges from the fronds,  
and whissspers  

"asmodeus liesss...  
asmodeus liesss..."
