livid i an eye to live  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and give it you a gift to give  
and i for an eye and an ear to be here  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we've fallen into yesteryear  

through poverty despite our cheer  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'll give-it-all and give-it-here  
your heart i hear a heartbeat near  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a gallop;thump a beat my ear  

i'll paint the sky i'll draw your stars  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'll take your heart with me to mars  
these starry days to starry nights  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine ears your sounds mine eyes your sights  

i'm wan--you're one; i've won, we've won  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there's no before, it's now--it's done  
to taste;to hear;to feel;to see  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this auricle mine: your oracle be
