your bird takes flight  
to great heights  
and then alights  
in an excoriated land.  

an excoriated land  
of souls, souls,  
surrounded by seas...  
a quarter of a tigress den.  

on its treacherous flight  
your bird passes  
a vacuum-land of  
bridges, wind, and silicon men...  

a cove of semiconductors  
gentrification  
and memories you'd rather not  
remember.  

and your bird will realize  
that should  
a phoenix burn,  
and a lively past turn to ember:  

there is gold in ashes
