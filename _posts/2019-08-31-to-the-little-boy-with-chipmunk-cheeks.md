to the little boy with chipmunk cheeks  
and candy in his eyes  
who can't eat sweets for a couple of weeks  
after his dental procedure, he was advised...  

though you pouted at first when i told you  
and you sat there steaming for a while  
when i gave you a sticker your eyes grew and grew  
and you broke out into a smile  

i thought i'd let you know, my friend  
you and your chipmunk cheeks  
made a tired student laugh to no end  
on a night that was otherwise bleak
