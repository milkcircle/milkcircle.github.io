entanglement,  
skin on skin  
tenderness --  
combat of intellect,  
affirmation of  
worthiness, forgiveness,  
affection, trust,  
simple presence and  
peace of mind,  
unspoken promises of  
company, support,  
empathy, and mercy,  

and the silent understanding  
of reciprocity, cooperation,  
and the mutual goal of goodness  
and betterment.
