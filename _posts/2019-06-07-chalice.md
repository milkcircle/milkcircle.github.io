the lathemaster  
woodspinner  
loads his tool  
with unsculpted walnut.  

"make me something  
i can pour my soul in"  
i ask him.  

and so he does.  

with dizzying speed  
and needle precision  
he carves me a chalice  
that i may serve wine in.  

here it is.  
a vessel of my blood  
my sweat  
and my tears  

and for you,  
nothing less  
than all my heart  
and all my soul  

and yet it's still not full.
