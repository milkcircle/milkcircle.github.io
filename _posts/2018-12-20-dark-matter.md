can love be weighed?  
because if it could  
my heart would be the world's heaviest object,  
a sole immutable rock even God Himself could not lift.  

does love have a volume?  
because if it did  
mine would be so expansive  
even the world's oceans couldn't wash away my sorrow.  

what temperature is love?  
because its embers  
warm my chest and flush my face  
and, extinguished, leave me ashen and shivering...  

if i can wear it on my sleeves,  
practically hold it in my hands  
if i can feel it in my throat,  
squeeze its essence from my eyes  

what makes it so elusive, unimaginable,  
inexpressible, untouchable,  
invisible  

that even when i shout it from the rooftops  
cry it from the skies  
set my soul aflame  

you fail to feel it too  
or even acknowledge its very existence?
