count,  
said the therapist to the silent man.  

when you find  
your mind  
racing  
when you find  
yourself blinded  
by anger  
resentment  
sorrow  
defeat  
when you see red  
in the heat  
of the moment  
don't let yourself  
lament.  

count.  

so he did.  

*one two three*  
three false idols  
in my unholy trinity  
three wishes upon  
a smoldering heathen star  
three lifeless words  
in i love you  

*four five six*  
flow my tears  
from endless springs  
my faith in her  
ever ills  
as she throws her words  
at me  
heavier than the  
sticks and stones  
i wish she'd heaved instead  
six, six, sick to the  
pit of my stomach i'm sick  
sick and i know  
i cannot be fixed  

*seven eight nine*  
oh how deceptively  
my cloud nine became  
nine inner circles  
of deviant hell  
nine days of mourning  
nine lives to live  
nine ways of showing  
i've none left to give  

and here the man took a moment to breathe  
a quiet hiatus to silently seethe  

a catch in his throat  
his tears dropped again  
he opened his mouth  
and then...  

he said *ten*  

and there on the floor he silently wept  
for all of the secrets whose burdens he kept  
he stumbled on home and at long last he slept  
and the heartbreaking truths he'd finally accept
