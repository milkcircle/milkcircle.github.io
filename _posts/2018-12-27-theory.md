syncopated! we were so  
lopsided  
but every night  
our grating tritone somehow resolved  
to a perfect fifth,  
just like that refrain in Maria...  
and we'd forget that when we walked together we had a limp.  

and when we weren't together  
we would talk in sevenths, and  
i'd keep waiting for the octave  
but until we met again  
life remained a seventh chord  

but we both knew  
our deceptive cadence was a temporary tonic  
and we were plagued by the promise  
of a true Plagal  
to send us home.
