they say we were in linkage  
like two SNPs side by side  
and if one were discovered  
the other couldn't hide  

and like a pair of lovers  
we held each other tight  
for who else in the world  
could hinder our delight?  

until one day we recombined  
and you and i were stranded  
suddenly the space between us  
twisted and expanded  

i stretched my arms and tried to reach  
and my heart plummeted
for how could i get to you  
from another chromatid?

the irony of linkage is  
the closer that we start  
if we were ever broken up  
we'd forever be apart

so i, alone, a desert island  
can't help but wonder whether  
the same destructive force might  
one day bring us back together
