as a pearl must be formed  
by an insult to the oyster  

or a drop of dew  
builds around a speck of dust  

or carbon turns to diamond  
in response to deadly pressure  

or a boy turns to man  
after years of pain and tumult...  

so do the little ones who suffer  
from their ailments and disease  

turn to gems and hearts of gold  
even more than warriors of old
