to run around the plains  
with a butterfly net  
following the flighted beauty  
whose elusive wings  
you cannot catch

is like trying to hunt a poem  
and pull it from thin air  
wisps of wisdom  
in rare rhymes  
flitting away  

you chase after it, hoping to hold onto  
at least a glimmer of inspiration  
a passing glance  
and you lunge at it with all your heart  

but all you bring home  
is an empty jar of want,  
broken promises,  
and misted tears.
