if it were up to me  
our story would begin  

as strangers' voices  
harmonizing over a song,  

then perhaps a saccadic glance  
and an a capella smile,  

an exchange of minor keys  
commiserating over tea,  

then a bluesy departure  
together, right before  

gravity shuts off,  
we tumble out the door  

grasping each other's hands  
floating into the night sky.
