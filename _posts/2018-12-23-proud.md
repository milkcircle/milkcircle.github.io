you walk into the classroom wearing  
a rotting albatross carcass  
proud  
forgetting its origin  
from that ancient mariner's rime  

and mask its decomposing odor  
with your elegant perfume  

the bird's blood leaking onto your rose-colored dress  
forming your scarlet symbol  
which you cover with  
a shiny down coat  

within which you carry  
that brutish unwashed dagger  
caked with the coagulants of prior providers  

and you walk through the world  
hair matted with the decaying fowl entrails  
your scars hidden in plain sight  

proud  

and attach yourself  
a parasitic faux hero  
in a foxhide gown  

not knowing  
your most recent caesar had not yet truly drawn his final breath  
not knowing  
he will not waste his last breath  
chanting your requiem tonight  

for he knows  
your perfume will fade  
your coat will not last  
your scars will darken  

and when they do  
your pride will perish as your facade crumbles,  
quaking under the tectonic plates of your shameful conscience.
