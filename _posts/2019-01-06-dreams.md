how many more days  
until the thought of you no longer twists me into a Gordian knot?  
how much longer  
until black clouds no longer hang over me  
and acid rain stops showering me with citrus tears?  

when will the silver linings appear  
when will the seasons change  

now i get it when people say  
they can be in the darkest of times  
even during the sunniest of days  

forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
