She places me  
An unknowing actor  
Unwittingly cast among an omniscient crew  
Trendelenberg  
Upon the dagger cold surface  
The subject of this sterile theatre's grotesque play

"Be still, my love  
This will be over soon"

And, tongue syrup thick,  
Eyelids heavy, mind drugged  
I plunge head over heels  
Into fitful sleep

Senses disabled, rhythms controlled  
I enter blissful agony  
As she, calculating without emotion  
Makes her first skin-deep incision  
And proceeds to explore

Hands twisting guts  
Her fingers feel the final flutters of those butterflies  
Dying inside the antrum of my stomach

Her knuckle, barely brushing the phrenic  
Paralyzing my diaphragm  
My breath catching --

And moving upward, massaging those chambers  
Made weak with love and want  
A synchronous muscle fluttering haphazardly in her presence

And in her cold focus  
Can she notice the beads forming on my forehead?  
The teardrop carving its winding route down my cheek? 

Finally, with surgical precision  
She sews me shut  
Pats me dry  
Wakes me up  
Sends me out

And I -- scarred, body lighter but heart heavier --  
Gaze back at the auditorium, searching for that cloaked clinician

But she has moved on.
