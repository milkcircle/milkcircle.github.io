when insatiable ingrates  
swallow whole  
their golden meals (wash down  
the particulates with rosewater gin  
and blackberry wine, and  
point for refills)  
they scarcely see  
the inflation of desires, in their  
delusions of grandeur,  
blurring the lines between  
requisites and luxuries,  
tastebuds dried from lack of use (having  
replaced tasteful dining with guzzling),  
glazed eyes oblivious to the  
heads nearby shaking in empathic shame.
