last week  
you picked me up  
and tossed me into the water  

i should have fought more  
but i sank like a rock  

and now, disoriented, breathless,  
i'm somewhere in the abyssopelagic  
and it's dark.

it only took a little time to figure out which way was up  
because every time i try to emerge  
the little breath left in my lungs  
like the shimmer of hope in my heart  
grows grows grows  

and crushes my chest like the thought of you  
until i settle back down again  
into the lower midnight.

what does it mean when i feel myself longing less for the light?  
how much time do i have left  
before i descend into hades?
