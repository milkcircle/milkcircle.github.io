you cannot have it all, my dear  
you cannot have it all  

but you can have love  
in the form of  
the transient squeeze of my hug  
a pressure around your waist  
when i leave in the morning  
and a small hint of a grin  
and the comfort in knowing  
that my eyes will smile  
with the thought of you.  

you can have pleasure  
in the little notes i leave  
and small gifts i hide  
in the form of  
cryptic messages  
embedded in a simple rhyme  
and the flutter in your heart  
when you decipher them.  

you can have my words  
the syllables we taste  
on the tips of our tongues  
which we chew like a piece of fruit  
to extract the sweetness of the  
meanings in our messages.  

you can have my toil and tears  
which i'll bake into the sweets  
that i make by hand for you  
and the cards i'll pepper around  
your home during the holidays  
so you're always with the images  
my idle mind forms of you.  

you can have my thoughts  
the quiet ruminations of  
silent gears that turn  
for all your troubles.  

you can have my attention.  
these bright eyes will fixate on you  
and glean your every move  
as you random-walk your way toward  
a delta made for us.  

for if i were your tree  
i'd be your giving tree  
and you could have my branches  
and you could have my trunk  
and you could have the shade i'd hold  
over your tired, lonesome head  

darling, you can't have it all, my dear...  
but all of what i have  
is yours.
