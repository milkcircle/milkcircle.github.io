patella, driven into  
carotid, crushing  
thyroid cartilage against  
gravelly pavement;  
damaged ventricle supplied by  
twice-replaced coronaries  
pumps against a growing gradient;  
lungs, soaked in sorrow and fear,  
drenched in backup fluid,  
borders reddening in blood  
and blurring in presyncope,  
where is mama,  
what am i doing wrong,  
let me breathe
