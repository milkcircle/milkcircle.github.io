pyrotechnics are  

transient bursts of color  
shimmering in your eyes  
like a sunset reflecting  
on the oscillating surface  
of the calming high tides  

fireworks are  

the respiratory sinus tachycardia  
jumpstarted by a sudden burst  
of adrenaline  
released when your touch  
triggers the mechanoreceptors  
within my jaded skin  

feu d'artifice  

is the ephemeral swell  
of pizzicato plucks  
peaking with the chaotic friction  
of resin on strings  

and when the lightshow ends   

you and i are the residual night sky  
with only the drifting smoke  
as evidence of the fleeting and vivid past.
