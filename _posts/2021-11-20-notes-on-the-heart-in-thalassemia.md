* a single transfusion will raise liver iron by 1mg/g
* the body can only eliminate the equivalent of one transfusion a year
* hemolysis can be thought to be slightly protective of iron overload as the iron is cleared in urine via the kidneys
* liver iron deposition is dependent on the average dose of chelator over time
* however, cardiac iron deposition is dependent on time spent chelated
* the consequence is that cardiac iron deposition can occur even with an adequate average dose of chelator titrated for prevention of hepatic iron loading
* any cardiac T2* less than 10ms is a risk factor for developing heart failure
* iron cardiomyopathy is completely reversible if the organs can be supported long enough
* there is suggestion that calcium channel blockade can be cardioprotective from this standpoint
* BID dosing of deferoxamine may be better than daily dosing
* splenectomy is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hypertension
* pulmonary hypertension results from abnormal mechanical forces and factors related to vasoconstriction that may result from ineffective erythropoiesis
* many patients may also have restrictive and fibrotic lung disease
* tricuspid regurgitation is a risk of pHTN in thalassemia and should be assessed every 1-3 years by echocardiogram
* chronic transfusion therapy can reverse pulmonary hypertension
* sildenafil can be considered for additional pulmonary hypertension management refractory to chronic transfusions
* HFpEF is an emerging complication of long-term thalassemia; risks include arrhythmias and prior iron overload
* thalassemia appears to age the heart by 10-15 years particularly if control of iron is suboptimal
* proximate mechanisms of HFpEF include inflammation, insulin resistance, and fibrosis
* by the time the heart is loaded, there is presumed iron-mediated damage to the pituitary gland and pancreas
* pancreas MRI screening is the "canary in the coalmine" in the sense that a clean pancreas implies a clean heart; iron deposition in the pancreas warrants closer cardiac MRI screening
* thalassemia intermedia carries a higher risk of pulmonary hypertension than thalassemia major
