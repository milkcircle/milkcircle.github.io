the day will come that i am gone  
and yet the planet will spin on  

birds will sing their favorite song  
and you'll be right where you belong  

the sun will set, then arc, then fall  
and beam its light upon us all  

the rains will gently cool us down  
and bring bright greens to what is brown  

and in the hour's final minute  
i'll see the light and bathe in it  

i'll slow my breath and heart, and then  
what will die will be born again  

the day will come that i am gone  
and yet the planet will spin on
