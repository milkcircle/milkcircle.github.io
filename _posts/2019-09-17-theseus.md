the day we were struck by lightning  
you and i disintegrated into a million pieces  
our giddy atoms bouncing in each other's  
devastatingly bright light  
intertwined in soul and mind  
locked and intermingled like laced fingers  
and for a split second we shared each other  
like the mind in split-brain syndrome  
confined in the same skull.  

the day we were struck by lightning  
we built each other back up piece by piece  
but not to our original entities;  
for some reason you could not fix my shattered heart  
and when i glued you back together with my bruised hands  
you looked at me differently  
and i wondered which part of me you were looking for  
and which piece i was missing.
