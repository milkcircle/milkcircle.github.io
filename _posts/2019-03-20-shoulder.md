when you laid your head upon my shoulder  
i melted.  

and you poured me into a jar  
and shined a light through me  
and it diffracted into a  
rainbow  
of a million desires.  

and my waves and particles  
danced hand in hand around your  
illuminated soul  

my photons bouncing in giddiness at the sight of you  

waiting for you to tip the jar over  
to let me immerse you in my glow.
