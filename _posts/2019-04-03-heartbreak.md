what is love without heartbreak?  

a youthful shout echoes from down the dim-lit street  
and a slow wind rustles the browning oaks.  

i clutch my flowerpetal in my hand  
looking to the overcast sky for answers.  

should i leave?  

i'm kicking the pebbles on the asphalt, remembering  
the soft taps we secretly shared under the table  
the inadvertent brushes turned to frantic hold-me-nows  
or forever hold your peace.  

the road we walked last summer is closed today, but no matter.  
i climb over the fence to the empty street  
so i can feel the familiar crisp breezes one more time  

there's a dying finch on the sidewalk,  
his vibrant colors matted with his own lifeblood  
and i ask him,  
what is life without death?  

what is life  
without the loss of life  
and what is bliss  
without its extinction?  

and the fledgling  
in his final chirps  
answers:  

there is no joy  
without consequence.  

and there is no beauty in reaching new heights  
without the risk of falling.  

i mourn the bird  
whose flight to the sun  
will send his soul to the stars,  
and i promise to bury his broken body.  

i grieve for the human mind  
and its inability to grasp my passerine friend's wisdom.  

the flowerpetal in my hand crumbles to ashen dust.
