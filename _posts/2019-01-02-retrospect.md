today  
i woke up to red skies  
black clouds  
a gray sun hanging from an invisible thread in the sky  
my blankets suffocated me like a ton of bricks  
and i wondered why i even opened my eyes.  

last month  
the hot oven door kissed the back of my hand  
leaving a tiny red scorch mark  
a microcosm of the heat i felt in my heart and my face  
as i carried the steaming food to you  
a smile so bright  
it seared itself into my eyes  
and i couldn't unsee it for days.  

last year  
we flew to distant islands  
on the backs of winged horses  
the skies which have since lost their luster  
were bursting with rainbows back then  
and we were kept warm in our carriage in the clouds  
we peered at the world from our ladders high in the heavens  
and clung to each other  
for the others were but specks on Earth  
and we were flying high in the troposphere  
with only each other to hold  

and that used to be enough.
