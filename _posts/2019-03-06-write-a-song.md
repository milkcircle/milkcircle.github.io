first  

you have to give your heart  
completely  
to someone else  

you must lay bare  
the recesses of your soul  

let her in  

show her your weaknesses  
the things that make you  
anxious depressed impulsive nervous  

human  

and in doing so  
let her tear down your stoic facade  
to reveal the inner workings of your mind and body.  

next  

you have to let her break your heart  
give her that beating organ  
to squeeze in her vicious fists  
and crush the hopes and dreams inside  

have her take your visions of the future  
and, one by one,  
shoot them down with poisoned arrows  

and, your mind now naked to the world  
absent its concrete wall  
let it soak in the rain  
let it fend for itself in the elements  
let yourself die through and through.  

then  
take your pain  
and gather up the worn-out pieces  

glue them together with  
a tragic melody  

make physical your inner hurt  
shred your fingers upon  
the sharp strings of a guitar  

form your agony into syllables  
wrap them neat and tidy  
hide your anguish beneath hopeful words.  

there's your song.  

sing it quiet  
and sing it to no-one else...  

for you've already shared yourself enough.  
now it's time to build back up that sturdy fort  
and brace yourself beneath an album of melancholy.
