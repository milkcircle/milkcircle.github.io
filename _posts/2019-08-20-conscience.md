deafeningly comes the thunder  
from overcast mournful skies  
and the townsfolk huddle in anxious masses:  
"tonight," they cry,  
"our sins will face judgment!"  

but the village children exchange sly glances,  
for they know  
that the conscience comes not in loud angry claps  
of zippered lightning,

but in shy whispered winds  
and quiet swells of waves  
and the occasional flutter of a soft heartbeat  

and though inaudible to the ear  
the conscience in this form  
masks all other sounds  
and its omnipotence  
reverberates and is felt  
in every atom of the body and mind.
