you were my homunculus  
that little hominid living in my cranium  

and you were always in my mind  
no matter where i went  

you took up residence in my sensory cortex  
so i carried you with me always  

and what you felt  
i felt  

when you were melancholy  
i was melancholy  

when you were irritated  
i was irritated  

when you were scared  
i was scared  

when you were happy  
my God  
i was happy  

the only thing that was different between us  
was that i loved you  
and you didn't love me back  

and when you left  
that little home you made inside my brain  
to be someone else's homunculus  

you left me  
numb.
