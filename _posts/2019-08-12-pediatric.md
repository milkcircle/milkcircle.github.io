to calm a crying child  
is to hold him, sick, with  
tears and rhinorrhea merging into  
a single stream of utter fear and despair  

a wailing tub of pure anxiety  
and walk around the unit, calm, whispering  
into his undictionaried ears  

to shh shh shh  
over his terrified babbling consonants  
pointing at the dolphins that splash in the wallpaper  

to rock back and forth  
and bounce up and down  
as though the two of you are in a plastic buoy  
drifting in the sea  

far away from this hallway place  
of hand sanitizers  
and golden gowns  
and pinch-nose masks  

until he falls asleep drooling on your pillow shoulders  
as you realize that deep inside  
your hardened adult shell  
you are wailing with him,  
wishing someone would let you weep into their shoulders too.
