there is a sound to love  
that even the deaf can hear.  

i've heard it before,  
just barely  
in the tail ends of the  
scarcely perceptible frequency spectrum.  

it is not  
(as others may have told you)  
the grunts of heavy breathing  
or the quiet pecks of lips on lips  
or the overused iloveyous  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;snapped at the end of the frustrated phone call  

nor is it  
the ring of wineglasses  
or the rustle of bedsheets  
or the muffled echoes of a distant party  
engulfed in your whispers and sighs.  

it is a much less common sound  
and, i submit, much more powerful,  
in that it sends shivers up and down your spine  
and wakes you more than caffeine.  

it is that sound  
when, after a long day of work,  
you and i come home, too tired to even speak  
too jaded to do anything, really  
and we kind of sink down into the cushion of the bed  

and in that moment before we surrender  
to the regimen of the night  
there's a glance that we share  
(a glint and reciprocal sparkle)  
that lets each other know we are aware of the comedy of our existence  
the drama of our togetherness  
and the romance of our routine  

in that moment  
that tired handheld silence we share:  
*that* is the sound of love.
