you're not a bad song.  

through the dissonance  
and the syn-  
copated beats that catch me off  
balance:  

there is something pure,  
nostalgic,  
even pleasant  
about you.  

though the lyrics decry goodness  
if you listen between the lines  
there might be some good yet.  

you're certainly no elevator music.  
on a scale from  
static noise to  
noise rock,  
you're somewhere in between.  

i'll listen to you.
