I wrote a short R script to take the exported data from Spendee and make a nice plot from it to visualize spending by category. The plot looks like this:  

![]({{ site.url }}/images/januaryspending.png)  

To use the script, save the following R code as $$\texttt{expenses.r}$$. Make sure to export your Spendee report (this can only be done via mobile device) following the instructions [here](https://medium.com/spendee/export-your-data-from-spendee-76b32804e8f1). Then run the following from your commandline:  

~~~ bash
Rscript expenses.r [path-to-Spendee] [begin-date-range] [end-date-range] [month] [output-image-name.png]
~~~

For instance, when I want to generate a spending plot of my January expenses, I run:  

~~~ bash
Rscript expenses.r data/Spendee.csv 2019-01-01 2019-01-31 January januaryspending.png
~~~

Make sure that the date range is in the format YYYY-MM-DD!  

The source code is below:  

~~~ R
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
args = commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)

# A script to visualize monthly spending by category, using ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Retrieve variables from command line
inpath <- args[1]
begin_range <- args[2]
end_range <- args[3]
month <- args[4]
outpath <- args[5]

print(paste0("beginning ", begin_range, " ending ", end_range))

# Import file as tibble
spending <- as_tibble(read.csv(inpath, header = T, stringsAsFactors = F))

# Discard income, and only keep transactions made after January 5th.
# Keep these entries in a tibble called "expenses"
expenses <- as_tibble(transform(spending, Date = as.Date(Date)))
expenses <- dplyr::filter(expenses, Date >= as.Date(begin_range) & Date <= as.Date(end_range))
expenses <- expenses[expenses$Category.Type == "expense",]

# Sum the expenses by category, and sort by expense dollar amount
sum_by_expense <- aggregate(Amount ~ Category.Name, data = expenses, FUN = function(x) sum(x)*-1)
sum_by_expense <- sum_by_expense[order(-sum_by_expense$Amount),]

print(sum_by_expense)

# PLOT SPENDING BY CATEGORY
# The theme() parameters 1) center the graph title, and 2) rotate the X-categories.
ggplot(data = sum_by_expense, aes(x=reorder(Category.Name,-Amount), y=Amount)) + # initiate plot
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="lightblue", color="black") + # bar graph
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,425), expand = c(0, 0)) + # force bars to start on the x-axis
  labs(title=sprintf("%s spending", month), x="Spending category", y="Dollar amount") + 
  theme_classic() + # remove gray background and grid
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggsave(outpath)
