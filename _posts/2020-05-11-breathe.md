uncertainty  
encloses the mind,  
a dust cloud  
for which the only  
safe response  
is to hold your breath,  
lungs screaming  
for excursion,  
chest twinging in  
impending defeat,  

until you remember  
that the only thing  
preventing your exhale  
is the mind's mirage...  
you are not drowning
