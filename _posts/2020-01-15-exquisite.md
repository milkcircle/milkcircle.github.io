exquisite,  
the slice of dawn before daybreak,  
when -- groggy, blurred -- the world  
spins into existence, a split second of  
confusion...then comfort,  
then touch, then bodily warmth,  
then quiet sleepy whispers,  

the first smile of day, the stretch, the  
initiative (then "just another minute",  
and a weighted slump into blissful quiet),  
the diaphragm waking up into a squeal of  
resolve.
