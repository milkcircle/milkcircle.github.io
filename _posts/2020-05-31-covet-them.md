covet them,  
the spit-upon  
wretches, the  
damaged,  

the quiet, the meek,  
the hustlers, the  
addicts,  
the broken,  

the street-rats, the  
gangsters, the jealous,  
the disreputed, the lazy,  

savor them, let them in,  
for they are the grit  
that will whet the righteous  
and polish that  
which is worth fighting for.
