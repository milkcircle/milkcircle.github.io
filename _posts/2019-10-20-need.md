you do not need to be  
the watercolor portrait of yourself  
your mind has painted for the world to see  

you do not need to walk the desert sands  
shackled in chains, burdened with the  
heavy tents and clothes and supplies on your back  
to reach some garden of eden  

you do not need to live up to  
whatever the world says it needs of you  

you need only to  
breathe in, breathe out,  
take joy in the breaths  

make merry in your every day  
and, when in grief,  
sit quiet in your tearful thoughts  

and know that every sun that sets  
will rise again in the next dawn  

when the dark is scattered by the youthful  
chirps of birds awakening  

and the yellow-reds match the burning of your heart  
as you remember your place in the universe
