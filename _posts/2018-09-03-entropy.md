our $$\mu$$ has grown considerably, it seems  
wouldn't you say?  
isn't it odd that  
a static coefficient supposedly independent of time  
can grow to paralyze our once springy love?

i suppose  
we suffer an unfortunate damping force  
and perhaps we are feeling its growing restraint  

might not the heat death of the universe  
apply to my universe as well?
will a lone traveller one day  
find the universe i once ruled as King of Kings  
eroded, decayed?
