you and i know that in the morning, when the sun rises it will shine its light on all the things that make us imperfect and incompatible, like a slow revelation that brightens with dawn, and in the light we will turn our backs to each other, sigh, and pace apart. but tonight, the sky is dim and the moon only shows the parts of us that fit, and everything has an azure glow, and you and i can see the stars in each other's growing pupils as we inch closer and closer to examine the beckoning shimmering reflections that glisten like freshwater ponds.
