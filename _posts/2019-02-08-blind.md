a bovine devil finds the windows to my soul  
and, standing at the windowsill  
she scratches, scrapes the shutters  
for she can't find a door to break down  

moonshine demon  
claws my eyes out  
tears the curtains  
cracks the lens  

moonshine demon  
sips my vitreous wine  

angel i can't let you in
