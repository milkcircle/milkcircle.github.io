remember when  
we shared a joke  
secret and quiet  
under the covers  
our toes touching  
our faces so close  
i could hear  
when you blinked  
and our breaths  
fast and shallow  
warmed each other  
while outside  
the streets were blanketed with snow  

remember when

you were my jetpack  
and i took you  
to the skies  
and we'd look down  
upon the wintered white abyss  
and we'd split pasta  
and glow with our wine  
and keep each other company  
in this lonely, troubled place  

remember when  
you'd make promises  
we both knew you couldn't keep  
and you'd say sweet nothings  
we both knew would soon sour  
and we'd ignore  
the impending hurricane  
its eye staring straight at me  
and pretend we only saw rainbows  

remember when  
i got caught in the storm  
and you flew away  
before it could catch you too  
and i, drenched in envy  
tossed into the rocks  
bloodied and broken  
watched as you flew high  
chasing the burning sun  
as i was banished to the ice  

and i woke up  
on the other side  
bruised but alive  
and found myself  
tucked in snug in my bed  
watching you follow the flaming stars  
until you were nothing but a speck in the sky  
and maybe a figment of my imagination  

and i can't help but wonder  
do you remember your time here?  
do you remember me?
