You -- a magnetic dipole -- induce my bipolar moments, our  
Rifts like drifts, or more like genetic shifts? A (ha)miltonian paradise lost  
Understand you may yet outgrow your prior mistakes, but how likely is it really, without proper proof of wrongdoing?  
Nevertheless... To have hope of that possibility perhaps  
Speaks to my weakness as a practical man, booksmart not streetsmart yet taught by the wrong books  
For why else would I be glued to a shitshow like us?  
Reverent for a never-ending ever after now irrelevant  
Unquarreled until recently, but even then still not yet truly at the wick's very end  
Wicked is the witch who feeds me that rope uncut to hang my hope and head  
Could I cut the rope to save my soul, and maybe even yours too?
