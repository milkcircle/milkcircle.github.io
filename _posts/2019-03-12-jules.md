jules--bejeweled--the other day  
passed and looked the other way  
she did her do and said her say  
her doppler sirens in decay  

never was there quite a lass  
with quite so much design for class  
she went her go and passed her pass  
adorned in manufactured glass  

joules--beloved--kissed me hard  
upside the head with mirror shards  
my face now painted, bled and scarred  
i smiled my smile and upped my guard  

jewels--artificial shines  
Verne in vermin sip your wines  
overlook your augur signs  
live your love and lie your lines
