in synchronous phase,  
the atria and ventricles  
pass between each other  
blood and potential,  
squeezing like fists,  
cycles of tension  
that never tire, and  
only with distraction --  
as with, say, love, or  
envy, or moaning sorrow -- do the  
flutters reveal themselves  
as chaotic endorphin-prone  
adrenaline-fueled lopsided  
beats, like those made when  
fists, driven by anger  
or defeat, slam themselves on  
the table, punching past the pain  
in red-hot regret, awaiting  
the return of ordered  
synchronous peace.
