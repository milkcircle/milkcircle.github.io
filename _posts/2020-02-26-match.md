wherever the wind blows  
(where it goes, who knows)  
wherever the wind will blow  
that's where i will go  

wherever the rain will land  
into the sea or upon the sand  
wherever the rain will land  
i'll bring you, hand in hand  

wherever the wind will blow -- my muse --  
i hope you'll let me know
