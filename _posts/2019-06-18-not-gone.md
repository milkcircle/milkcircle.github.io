do not despair:  

although i am not with you here  
you'll know i'm with you far and near  

i am the warmth that quells your fears  
i am the salt inside your tears

i am the chirps that songbirds sing  
i am the calm that breezes bring  

i am the beats inside your chest  
i am your spices and your zest  

and though you must now carry on  
i am not gone  

i am not gone
