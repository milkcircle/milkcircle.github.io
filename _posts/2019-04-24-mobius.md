a möbius strip. we run you and i  
in opposite directions  
like t>0 in a perfectly elastic collision.  

you toward a summerland, and i  
headfirst into frost.  

we fade in each other's memories  
and wisp into lossy static  
like degenerate matrices.  

all the while unaware  
that our lives form
