my psychedelic eyes  
see the sterling butterflies  
those i wish i could afford  
to give to one whom I've adored  

my schizophrenic ears  
hear your whispers through my tears  
those honeyed words you purr  
warm my soul like sweet liqueur  

my delirious mind  
dreams the reverie i'd hoped to find  
hallucinating you  
in a fit of déjà vu  

and in this wild psychotic break  
i cannot tell the real from fake  

but i don't know whether  
i'd rather wake...  

or dream us back together
