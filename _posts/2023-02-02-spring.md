wait, wait -  
wait.  

in this moment after the sky splinters,  
right before the sun burns dry  

the dark will wait, the cold will wait,  
the end will wait,  

to let us share the last smile,  
give our last glance,  
feel one more embrace,  

for me to whisper  
you are Spring,  
you are light  

let's wait and see what happens
