shame is the story of how  
you left for "ambition" ("i said i loved you but you shouldn't have expected anything, your hurt was your fault")  
became you came back for "change in values" ("sorry sorry but when i was with him i was thinking of you")  
became you started chatting with an ex overnight -- "don't worry about the hike it's in a group" --  
became you stayed up texting guys about how incompatible we were --  
became you left for a lack of desire to change (and for difference in "ambition")  
(and probably for someone you've been talking to)  
became i saw that you'll never change,  
became i came to realize that a person's "good" or "bad" was the sum of the person's choices, and you have always chosen bad, selfish, hurtful  
became i saw after taking off the rose colored glasses that you've always been draped in a red flag,  
became i gave up on changing for a person who would never change  
became i'm looking for something better.  

darling, i stand by my unconditional love, but  
can't ignore any longer that you are, by your own definition, a bad person  
(despite how easily you can fake it)  
and seem to be proud of it  
and i find it so sad to see  

here's to hoping you will find someone  
who will bend over backward to accept your flaws  
as much as i have tried
