to sing for you  
is to plunge headfirst  
into pitch black  
wondering whether there is anyone to catch me  

i do it anyway  
knowing the near-nil chance of you  
finding clue after clue  
and deciphering them  

and as i fall i wonder  
do you like it?  
do you see it?  
do you hear it?  

are you even here?  

should i go on?
