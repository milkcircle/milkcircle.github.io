Below is a growing collection of medical literature I have read along with some summary thoughts.

Genetics
===
1. 07/2018 -- PrimateAI ([paper](../download/201807_primateai.pdf)). 
	*Sundaram, et. al.* published a deep neural network trained on a set of hundreds of thousands of common variants using a small population of 6 non-human primate species, and demonstrated that their new tool is powerful at classifying benign and pathogenic variants in humans. Notably, PrimateAI is unbiased compared to prior pathogenicity classifiers as it does not take human-classified ClinVar variants as input. PrimateAI also incorporates a secondary structure prediction model and solvent accessibility prediction model which takes as input a variant and its surrounding 102 amino acid sequence.

2. 02/2017 -- Cardiovascular polygenic risk score ([paper](../download/201702_prs_cardiovascular.pdf)).
	*Natarajan, et. al.* describe developing a polygenic risk score from 57 SNPs which predicted additional benefit from statin therapy. This study demonstrated several important points. 1) Statins confer a greater risk reduction in those patients at high genetic risk, determined by the polygenic risk score. Interestingly this group does not on average have higher LDL levels compared to lower genetic risk subgroups. 2) Asymptomatic individuals with no history of coronary heart disease have higher burden of subclinical atherosclerosis with higher PRS. The PRS only incorporates common genetic variation but is not validated in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

3. 03/2017 -- Rare and common variants in LPL associated with coronary artery disease ([paper](../download/201703_rare_common_cvd.pdf)).
	*Khera, et. al.*

Hematology
===
1. 07/2018 -- CRIPSR screen identifies HRI as fetal globin regulator ([paper](../download/201807_hri_crispr.pdf)). 
	*Grevet, et. al.* developed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen to target protein kinases, which theoretically are easier to target by small molecules. They identified the heme-regulated inhibitor HRI (a.k.a. EIF2AK1) as an inducer of HbF, and found that although HRI has been shown previously to play a role in global translation, the elevation of HbF was remarkably specific. In follow-up experiments, they used short-hairpin RNA to knock down HRI and demonstrated 1) reproducible HbF elevations, 2) diminished sickling of CD34$$^+$$ HbSS cells, 3) decreased BCL11A protein expression with HRI knockdown, and 4) unimpaired erythrocyte maturation with HRI knockdown. This evidence points toward HRI as a potential target for HbF induction and characterizes HRI as a potential upstream player of the BCL11A pathway. However, importantly HRI has a role in global protein translation, which may make clinical translation difficult. Furthermore, HRI$$^{-/-}$$ mice have been previously shown to display impaired adaptation to iron deficiency, and had phenotypes of thalassemia.

2. 04/2018 -- NETs promote thrombosis in MPNs ([paper](../download/201804_nets_mpn_thrombosis.pdf)).
