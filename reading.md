I often read medical literature in my free time to stay up-to-date with my areas of interest -- namely genetics and hematology. Here is a selection of papers I have read, many of which are accompanied by thoughts and comments.

Genetics
===
1. 07/2018 -- PrimateAI ([paper](../download/primateai.pdf)). *Sundaram, et. al.* publish a deep neural network trained on a set of hundreds of thousands of common variants using a small population of 6 non-human primate species, and demonstrate that their new tool is powerful at classifying benign and pathogenic variants in humans. Notably, PrimateAI is unbiased compared to prior pathogenicity classifiers as it does not take human-classified ClinVar variants as input. PrimateAI also incorporates a secondary structure prediction model and solvent accessibility prediction model which takes as input a variant and its surrounding 102 amino acid sequence.

Hematology
===
1. 07/2018 -- CRIPSR screen identifies HRI as fetal globin regulator ([paper](../download/hri_crispr.pdf)).
