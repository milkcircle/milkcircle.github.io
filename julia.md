these are for you  
do they make you smile?

although i am not with you here
you’ll know i’m with you far and near

i am the warmth that quells your fears
i am the salt inside your tears

i am the chirps that songbirds sing
i am the calm that breezes bring

i am the heartbeats in your chest
i am your spices and your zest

and though you must now carry on
i am not gone

i am not gone
