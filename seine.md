*there is a thing called love*  
(a poem constructed for you,  
as all my poems are)

there is a thing called love  
that -- quiet, humble -- soars above  
the hearts of ordinary men  
and finds you, descending only then  

to perch upon your shoulders high  
and -- peace at last -- lets out a sigh  
as butterfly and bird unite  
in winged embrace, and then take flight  

there is a thing called love -- darling --  
it chirps a tune fit for a starling  
it weeps in sorrow only when  
it loses that which could have been  

it needs no more than to believe  
that what it gives has been received  
it wants no less than all the world  
for you -- my darling -- sweet and pearled  

there is a thing called love, my love  
it's all that i've been thinking of  
i'd hold your hands in mine, and then  
i'd bring you with me along the Seine  

there is a thing called love, my dear  
it's more resilient than it might appear  
i have enough to give to you  
do you feel it for me too?  

aaroncheng.me/{  
you've guessed what i'd make you  
you've guessed where i'd take you  
can you guess what i'd give you?  
have you given up?  
think hard, love -- you asked for it  
i gave it  
you took it  
and you threw it away }  

there's someone new  
should i wait?
