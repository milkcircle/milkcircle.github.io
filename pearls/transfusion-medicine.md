### Adverse events ###
#### TACO and TRALI ####
It is a strange quirk of nomenclature that the two most severe acute adverse events caused by blood transfusions sound completely benign. TACO and TRALI aren't exactly the most dramatic or inspired acronyms for deadly events. Nevertheless, we'll work with what we have.

**What is the difference between these two clinical entities?** Although mechanisms of TACO (transfusion-associated circulatory overload) and TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) are not yet fully understood, we know that TACO causes cardiogenic pulmonary edema, while TRALI causes leaky lungs from presumably an underlying inflammatory/immune pathology as a hypersensitivity reaction to blood products[^1]. Both syndromes carry high risk of morbidity/mortality, particularly TRALI -- which carries only a 53-83% survival rate, depending on baseline health[^2].  

Clinically, both of these syndromes manifest as acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia within 6 hours of a blood transfusion. A chest radiograph shows fluffy schmutz (don't say this on rounds) indicative of pulmonary infiltrates and edema (**figure 1**). The diagnostic criteria differs between TACO and TRALI by whether there is evidence to suggest that the pulmonary edema is cardiogenic.

TRALI is a diagnosis of exclusion; a syndrome should only be called TRALI once other causes of pulmonary edema (i.e. pneumonia, aspiration, etc.) are ruled out. (This is in stark contrast to, for example, acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease, where essentially any kid with SCD and some respiratory findings will be ruled in for ACS.) Similarly, in cases of possible TACO, causes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema -- like cardiac ischemia -- should be ruled out before jumping to a diagnosis of TACO.  

**Diagnostic tests you may or may not want to order to distinguish between TRALI and TACO**
* Hydrostatic pulmonary pressure (increased in TACO)
* Proteinacious edema fluid is exudative and suggestive of TRALI
* TACO may respond to diuretics
* Possibly elevated systolic blood pressure in TACO
* NT-proBNP may be elevated in TACO (but is also probably already elevated in critically ill people anyway)[^4]
