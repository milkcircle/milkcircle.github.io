## Adverse events ##
### TACO and TRALI ###
It is a strange quirk of nomenclature that the two most severe acute adverse events caused by blood transfusions sound completely benign. TACO and TRALI aren't exactly the most dramatic or inspired acronyms for deadly events. Nevertheless, we'll work with what we have.

**What is the difference between these two clinical entities?** Although mechanisms of TACO (transfusion-associated circulatory overload) and TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) are not yet fully understood, we know that TACO causes cardiogenic pulmonary edema, while TRALI causes leaky lungs from presumably an underlying inflammatory/immune pathology as a hypersensitivity reaction to blood products[^1]. Both syndromes carry high risk of morbidity/mortality, particularly TRALI -- which carries only a 53-83% survival rate, depending on baseline health[^2].  

Clinically, both of these syndromes manifest as acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia within 6 hours of a blood transfusion. A chest radiograph shows fluffy schmutz (don't say this on rounds) indicative of pulmonary infiltrates and edema (**Figure 1**). The diagnostic criteria differs between TACO and TRALI by whether there is evidence to suggest that the pulmonary edema is cardiogenic.

TRALI is a diagnosis of exclusion; a syndrome should only be called TRALI once other causes of pulmonary edema (i.e. pneumonia, aspiration, etc.) are ruled out. (This is in stark contrast to, for example, acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease, where essentially any kid with SCD and some respiratory findings will be ruled in for ACS.) Similarly, in cases of possible TACO, causes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema -- like cardiac ischemia -- should be ruled out before jumping to a diagnosis of TACO.  

**Diagnostic tests you may or may not want to order to distinguish between TRALI and TACO**
* Hydrostatic pulmonary pressure (increased in TACO)
* Proteinacious edema fluid is exudative and suggestive of TRALI
* TACO may respond to diuretics
* Possibly elevated systolic blood pressure in TACO
* NT-proBNP may be elevated in TACO (but is also probably already elevated in critically ill people anyway)[^3]  

People might convince you that one way to tell between TACO and TRALI is by body temperature. This is less true than most people are led to believe, since a substantial number of TACO patients are febrile and therefore renders this test nonspecific[^4]. The better way to distinguish between the two is to look for clinical signs of cardiac compromise and/or volume overload.  

#### Possible pathophysiology ####

Scientists really like the phrase "two-hit hypothesis". They've used it for cancer, schizophrenia, and now they're adapting it for the highly specific case of TACO and TRALI[^5]. The proposed mechanism is simple: 1) the patient has some underlying non-resilience -- for instance, an intolerance of large volume shifts, and 2) something in the blood product tips the patient over the edge.  

This is supported by evidence that patients with underlying heart or kidney disease are at an increased risk of TACO when they receive blood products[^6]. The second hit may be factors like inappropriate fluid management and rapid infusion rates[^8].  

In TRALI, risk factors are more related to immune physiology and include things like smoking, shock, alcohol abuse, low IL-10 levels, and signs of systemic inflammation[^7]. The second hit in TRALI seems to be, in most cases, anti-HLA or anti-HNA antibodies; in other cases, blood product factors like lipids, extracellular vesicles, and simply old age of the blood are speculated to lead to TRALI[^9]. It should be noted that neutrophils, monocytes, and (weaker evidence of) platelets seem to be pathogenic in TRALI, whereas Tregs and dendritic cells appear to be protective[^1].  

#### So what do I do when my patient has TACO or TRALI? ####

**TACO**
* Trial diuresis, and provide supplementary oxygen. If hypoxemia persists or gets worse, consider intubation.

**TRALI**
* Oxygen and possible intubation.
* Play around with pressors and fluids to make sure the patient is hemodynamically stable.

**Preventive measures**
* Defer donors whose blood has previously triggered TACO/TRALI
* Prefer male over female blood (males, for some reason, develop fewer anti-WBC antibodies)[^10]



### Alloimmunization ###

Few things are more terrifying than a patient who chronically needs blood who can no longer receive blood products. I have seen a patient with thalassemia who was so allosensitized that it became very difficult to find compatible blood, and as a result he required a splenectomy and hydroxyurea maintenance (both of which are not first-line therapies for thalassemia) as a last ditch effort to improve hemoglobin levels in the absence of regular blood transfusions.  

There are many things we can discuss about alloimmunization that will ultimately get us into the weeds of immunology, which likely won't benefit us too much. Here I give a broad overview of alloimmunity, and in particular focus on risk factors for allosensitization.  

#### What is alloimmunization? ####

Red blood cells have a ton of antigens. We can only screen for a subset of antigens using serologic tests in the laboratory, but there are way more antigens than can be tested with modern methods. When a patient gets blood from someone else, they are exposed to a bunch of RBC antigens that could theoretically trigger the development of antibodies against these antigens. If antibodies develop and patients are exposed again to these antigens, an immune response might be triggered, causing massive hemolysis. Some antigens are more immunogenic than other antigens, and a variety of factors such as antigen density and class influence whether antibodies are likely to be formed against them[^11].  

#### Who gets allosensitization? ####

It turns out there's a good way to think about the populations who are at elevated risks of developing antibodies against RBCs. People who are regularly transfused are clearly at the highest risk. However, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, those who are regularly transfused and who began transfusions at a very early age are less likely to develop alloimmunization compared to those who are only intermittently transfused[^12]. Furthermore, allosensitization is far more likely to occur when patients are transfused in an inflammatory state (for instance, during acute chest syndrome or during a viral illness)[^13]. Considering the fact that patients with sickle cell disease are basically only transfused when they're in an inflammatory crisis, this makes patients with SCD at particularly high risk of alloimmunization. In fact, prevalence of RBC alloantibodies is highest in patients with SCD (**Figure 2**)[^14]. This observation also holds up in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (who have higher rates of alloimmunization) and patients on steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy (who have lower rates of alloimmunization).
