### Adverse events ###
#### TACO and TRALI ####
It is a strange quirk of nomenclature that the two most severe acute adverse events caused by blood transfusions sound completely benign. TACO and TRALI aren't exactly the most dramatic or inspired acronyms for deadly events. Nevertheless, we'll work with what we have.

**What is the difference between these two clinical entities?** Although mechanisms of TACO (transfusion-associated circulatory overload) and TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) are not yet fully understood, we know that TACO causes cardiogenic pulmonary edema, while TRALI causes leaky lungs from presumably an underlying inflammatory/immune pathology as a hypersensitivity reaction to blood products[^1]. Both syndromes carry high risk of fatality, particularly TRALI -- which carries only a 53-83% survival rate, depending on baseline health[^2].
