## Alimentary prophylaxis

### The gut hypothesis
When you see a septic patient crashing in the ICU, a natural question to ask is where the source of infection comes from. The hypothesis that pathogenic organisms mainly originate from being introduced through catheters has been put into question (if this were the case, why are peripheral catheters not a risk factor for sepsis?), and the "gut hypothesis" has become a prevailing theory of the origin of sepsis.  

The gut hypothesis claims that hypoperfusion to the gut allows for intermittent ischemia and allows translocation of enteric bacteria into the bloodstream (hence the prevalence of enteric organisms found in sepsis). This eventually leads to a positive feedback loop leading to multiorgan failure[^1].

### Gastric acid
Gastric acid has a role in creating a sterile environment in the stomach, and has a less important role in nutrient digestion/absorption. This is why people with achlorhydria do not suffer malabsorption[^2].

### Stress ulcers
Almost every patient in the ICU probably has an oozing gastric ulcer[^3]. Although fewer than 5% of patients ultimately go on to develop clinically significant bleeding, prophylaxis should probably be implemented in most or all of these patients.  

### Gut prophylaxis options

| Medication name | Drug class | Mode | Dosing |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Famotidine | H<sub>2</sub> blocker | IV | 20mg Q12h |
| Ranitidine | H<sub>2</sub> blocker | IV | 50mg Q8h |
| Lansoprazole | PPI | NG | 30mg QD |
| Omeprazole | PPI | NG | 20mg QD |
| Pantoprazole | PPI | IV | 40mg QD |
| Sucralfate | Protectant | NG | 1g Q6H |

#### H<sub>2</sub> blockers
* Dose renally, as overdosing can cause agitation and confusion in those with renal failure
* Very slight increased risk of *C. diff* infection or aspiration pneumonia  

#### Proton pump inhibitors
* More potent than H<sub>2</sub> blockers
* Does not require renal dosing
* Higher risk of infection (GI, pulmonary) compared to H<sub>2</sub> blockers
* Can impede **clopidogrel** antiplatelet activity[^4]!

#### Sucralfate
