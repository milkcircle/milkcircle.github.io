## Central venous access

It's not possible to textually teach someone how to establish central venous access. For this, we have Youtube. But there are important things to know about when we might want to pursue central venous access, and pitfalls to look out for. So when might we be interested in pulling the trigger and saying, "You know what? Today's the day to poke a bigger hole in this patient than usual"?  

* The patient is a really hard stick, maybe because his/her vasculature is all kinds of screwed up from drug use, or because the patient is morbidly obese and finding peripheral veins is just not possible to do without subjecting him to role-playing a pincushion.
* Special drugs like vasoconstrictors or total parenteral nutrition
* Need for a multilumen catheter to deliver a bunch of medications at once
* You need access for a really long time, longer than a peripheral IV is expected to last
* You need to do something special, like dialysis or float a Swan-Ganz catheter

Fortunately for us, even in patients with bleeding/coagulation disorders, central access is not contraindicated[^1]. We just need to be a little more careful.  

### Internal jugular vein

* So you've just punctured your patient's carotid artery while trying for jugular venous access. What do you do? 
  Answer: just remove the small-bore probe and compress the neck for 5 minutes. Compress for longer if your patient has risk factors like a coagulopathy.
* So you've cannulated the carotid. This is different and requires vascular surgery to come. The patient could stroke[^2].

### Subclavian vein

* If you're going for the subclavian, might I suggest using an ultrasound[^3]? Complications of subclavian access include pneumothorax and nerve injury, both of which occur less frequently with the use of an ultrasound machine as a guide.
* If your patient will need a hemodialysis site, try to stay away from the subclavian vein on the ipsilateral site of the arteriovenous fistula, since subclavian stenoses commonly occur[^4].
* Subclavian vein access is generally more comfortable for patients compared to other sites.

### Femoral vein

* Femoral vein thrombosis is a common complication, but this is often clinically silent[^5].
* Avoid using the femoral vein during cardiac arrests, since drug delivery can be delayed!
* Do not get femoral access in patients with DVTs[^6].
* Femoral vein access is contraindicated in patients with abdominal trauma, since the IVC could be disrupted[^6]!

### Peripherally inserted central catheters

* Honestly these are probably the way to go if you have the option. Easy to do (especially with ultrasound) with minimal risks.
* The most common complication is PICC-associated thrombosis, particularly in cancer patients[^7].

### Complications

#### Air embolus
* In spontaneous respiration, breathing creates a negative pressure gradient that, combined with a point of air entry above the right atrium, creates the risk of introducing air into the vasculature and causing a fatal embolus.
* A large enough air embolus can cause heart failure, leaky capillary pulmonary edema, and if there's a patent foramen ovale, an acute stroke[^8].
* Your patient may not show any symptoms, or may start having difficulty breathing with a cough. 
* Physical exam may reveal a murmur
