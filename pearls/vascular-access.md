## Central venous access

It's not possible to textually teach someone how to establish central venous access. For this, we have Youtube. But there are important things to know about when we might want to pursue central venous access, and pitfalls to look out for. So when might we be interested in pulling the trigger and saying, "You know what? Today's the day to poke a bigger hole in this patient than usual"?  

* The patient is a really hard stick, maybe because his/her vasculature is all kinds of screwed up from drug use, or because the patient is morbidly obese and finding peripheral veins is just not possible to do without subjecting him to role-playing a pincushion.
* Special drugs like vasoconstrictors or total parenteral nutrition
* Need for a multilumen catheter to deliver a bunch of medications at once
* You need access for a really long time, longer than a peripheral IV is expected to last
* You need to do something special, like dialysis or float a Swan-Ganz catheter

Fortunately for us, even in patients with bleeding/coagulation disorders, central access is not contraindicated[^1]. We just need to be a little more careful.  

### Internal jugular vein

* So you've just punctured your patient's carotid artery while trying for jugular venous access. What do you do? 
  Answer: just remove the small-bore probe and compress the neck for 5 minutes. Compress for longer if your patient has risk factors like a coagulopathy.
* So you've cannulated the carotid. This is different and requires vascular surgery to come. The patient could stroke[^2].

### Subclavian vein

* If you're going for the subclavian, might I suggest using an ultrasound[^3]? Complications of subclavian access include pneumothorax and nerve injury, both of which occur less frequently with the use of an ultrasound machine as a guide.
* If your patient will need a hemodialysis site, try to stay away from the subclavian vein on the ipsilateral site of the arteriovenous fistula, since subclavian stenoses commonly occur[^4].
* Subclavian vein access is generally more comfortable for patients compared to other sites.
