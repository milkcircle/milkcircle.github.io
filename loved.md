you are  
when the light cracks at the birth of dawn,  
the knowledge that the dark has an end,  
and the day has a beginning,  
and there's a home to return to  
at the close of hell  

you've been  
the spice to an unassuming life,  
the sparks in a monochrome sky,  
the reason why i wake  

how can i do anything but feel  
the exquisite hurt of a half torn away?
