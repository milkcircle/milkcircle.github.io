why i defend you  
when so many of your friends talk behind you  
and tell me why i'm better off  
avoiding a shallow dishonest  
money-hungry person who will never change  

why i still defend you  
i do not know  
except that maybe i feel sorry  
that you haven't deceived your friends  

acme{ gift is here }
