"your honesty deserves the same on my part in kind,"  
you said,  
as you laughed at the  
scum of the earth before you  
and wondered just how much more you could get away with  

until the weight of your words  
could cut deep enough to kill him...  

the demonic and lazy  
are remorseless in their actions,  
unchanging in their vices,  
sarcastic in their apologies,  
and pitiful.
