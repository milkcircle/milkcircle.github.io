How sad is it, that the secret of the universe is borne from you and you alone, yet you are the sole human who cannot see it! For you, darling, *you* are the universe, and your smile is its light. And your laughter -- why, your laughter, in units of giggles, is the engine that makes this world spin, and makes my heart spin, and makes me dizzy with delight. And to think, that all the secret of the universe is found between your pink carnation lips, and that I got to see it every day! What a wonderful gift to have, and to share, to make rainbows blossom from your every word and butterflies sing with every smile.  

And how devastating is it, that once we have seen the light we can never unsee it. What a sorrowful moment: to peel back the skin of the dark and reveal underneath the bleeding capillaries of truth and ugliness and soot and grime and clean it with your essence, your shine, and to have to sew it back up again. For we can't choose what we want, can we? And we can't decide what we're better off without. Perhaps that is the reason why there is conflict and friction and heartbreak in the world.  

So it must be -- keep the ones you love too much at a distance, for they are magnets that grow in attraction proportional to inverse radius squared. Keep them at a distance, so the inevitable collision of metal on metal is kept at bay. And maybe this distance isn't to be maintained forever. Maybe the magnets inch toward each other, bit by bit... imperceptible at first (since of course they start far apart), but on a crash course toward the other in such a way that one day, *snap!* they're back at it again, destroying each other in a fit of attraction.  

And so it is, that the things I want will end up killing me. I will fall into yellow, and orange, and pink, and red, and come out black and blue and bleeding, but seeing roses, and I will send them to you --  

May your singing rays of sunshine be everlasting, your radiance be unclouded, your resonance be unhindered, your vibrance be forever reverberant. Happy Thanksgiving
