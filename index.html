      <p>Welcome to my personal website. Here you can find a growing collection of my writing; I enjoy reflecting on my experiences as a student as well as experiences I've had outside of school. As an incoming medical student, I plan to use this website as a place to process and introspect about my journey to become a doctor. </p>

<p>Some background about me: I studied Chemical and Physical Biology (with a minor in Math) at Harvard College from 2011-2015. I am currently a first-year student at Harvard Medical School. I am interested in finding a balance between writing, science, entrepreneurship, and patient care; the coming years will hopefully inform me on how to forge my own unique path in medicine. I will go into medical school with more experience in hematology than in any other subject (indeed, I have seen the field of hematology through the eyes of a patient, a student researcher, and a volunteer; these experiences have given me a somewhat comprehensive understanding of the status of medical care in the field of benign blood disorders). Outside of school, I enjoy attending heavy metal concerts, playing chess, reading, writing, and hiking.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy my thoughts.</p>
